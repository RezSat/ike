For free distribution21.1 Basic Concepts about Businesses
When the social existence of a human develops, individual needs also widened 
gradually. When the needs and wants were diversified, it was difficult to produce all 
their needs and wants by themselves. As a remedy to this problem, people started to 
produce a large quantity of goods that they could produce the best, with the skills 
and resources they had. Therefore, an excess of goods was created. Then people 
exchanged their excess goods with others to obtain other goods they wanted. This 
system of exchanging goods was known as the 'Barter System'.
Even today, no one produces all what he or she wants. The farmer produces rice; the 
carpenter makes furniture; the teacher teaches. This individual is either a producer 
or a consumer in different instances. Such producers and consumers fulfill their 
needs and wants through businesses. Therefore, businesses are given immense 
importance in the modern society.
Business Concept
Man needs goods and services from birth to death. These needs and wants are 
fulfilled by the businesses. Businessmen manufacture and distribute various 
goods and services according to the human needs and wants. The way businesses 
manufacture and distribute goods and services and the way man fulfills his needs 
and wants have become different and complex today.
A business is an economic activity which manufactures or provides different goods 
and services in order to fulfill human needs. Most of the firms are profit oriented 
whereas some firms are not profit oriented. Especially, most of the businesses in the 
government sector are driven by the social welfare motive. Even though a majority 
of private sector businesses are driven by the profit motive, some firms are also 
driven by the welfare motive.
A majority of production activities carried out manually in the past are now carried 
out using new technology. Most of the businesses do their transactions through 
electronic media. Therefore, today, any business activity such as ordering goods, 
paying money and advertising etc can be performed rapidly and easily through 
electronic media. Due to the accelerating growth in information and communication 
technology, the world has become a global village through electronic media. Any 
individual in any country is now consuming different goods produced in different 
countries in order to fulfill their needs and wants. The following activity will 
facilitate you to understand the extent to which your daily life has been connected 
to the global market today.
For free distribution3
         Activity 01
List down the names of different goods that you consume within a selected day and 
write down the country of manufacture of each good in front.
Business Objectives
As a consumer your objective is to obtain 
a quality product at a reasonable price to 
satisfy a need. Similarly, consumers and 
other different stakeholders of businesses 
have specific objectives to be fulfilled. Every 
business has a specific objective or set of 
objectives to be achieved, because the parties 
such as owners of a business, its managers, 
employees, customers, government and 
community expect different returns from a 
business. 
The following are some business objectives that can be seen in common in a profit 
oriented business
01. Earning profits
 Profit earning objective is essential for a business because it has to pay a   
 sufficient return to the owners for their investment. 
02. Increasing customer satisfaction
 The survival of a business depends on how it satisfies the needs and wants   
 of its customers.  
In achieving the above objectives, businesses need to focus on sub objectives. Some 
of them are discussed below.
(a)  Increasing the quality of goods and services
 Businesses intend to provide quality goods and services at a reasonable  
 price as well as to fulfill consumer needs and wants.
(b)  Generating employment opportunities
 Another goal of businesses is to generate different job opportunities from 
 labourers to top managers.
Figure 1.1
For free distribution4(c)  Employee welfare
 Providing various welfare facilities in addition to wages to satisfy the   
 employees is another objective of most of the businesses. Food,   
 accommodation facilities, transportation facilities and medical facilities are   
 some examples for those various welfare facilities offered by a business.
Consumer needs and wants
Needs
Human needs are requirements that must 
be fulfilled essentially for existence. Food, 
clothing and shelter are considered as the 
basic human needs and when the society  
develops, education, health, security, 
transportation, communication and 
entertainment are also recognized as human 
needs. The following characteristics can be 
seen in human needs.

wants of consumers. These wants have following characteristics.
Characteristics of wants
    Y  Not essential   
  - For existence it is not essential to fulfill a want as that need could   
    be satisfied by another similar want instead.
 Y  Being diverse   
  - Even though the needs are common to any individual, the way they   
    satisfy them differs depending on their socio - economic condition.
 Y  Can be created  
  - Businessmen can create wants.
 Y  Being complex

For a business to be successful, it is essential to pay constant attention to its 
environment. New business opportunities can be identified through the changes 
in environmental forces and different trends arising in the environment.Therefore,

 time.
 Businesses now use telephones and e-mails instead of the snail mail used in  
 the past.
 In early days, businessmen published their advertisements with  their

 e-mail addresses and invite  customers to visit their web site for more  
 information.

of the business independently. In addition, he will be  the owner, leader as well as

Accounting can be explained as a process of providing information required by the 
interested parties of a business for their decision making. Financial information is 
very important in decision making in a business. Accounting that mainly provides 
financial information is called as Financial Accounting. 
4.2 Objectives and need of Accounting
As mentioned above, Accounting is needed to provide useful information to 
interested parties of a business for their decision making. Further, the business 
activities also impact various other parties. All these parties including owners and 
debt holders are named as interested parties (stakeholders) of a business. Owners, 
debt holders, investors, customers, suppliers, employees and the government  are 
usually considered as key interested parties among other parties. Each party takes 
decisions in various nature and for that they require information. Accordingly, 
providing information for decesion making is the main objective of accounting. 
Based on this main objective, there are various other objectives and few of such  
objectives are given below.
  To know whether the business has earned an adequate profit
  To know whether the financial position of the business is sound
  To fulfill legal requirements (presentation of financial reports is a   
      mandatory requirement by law for some organisations)
  To minimize disadvantages arising through ommission and commission   
     of transactions, and to organize financial activities
In order to fulfill above objectives, accounting provides various types of reports to 
the interested parties. These reports are generally termed as Financial Statements. 
These financial statements are based on business transactions.
For free distribution494.3 Business transactions
When a business carries out its activities, it requires to exchange resources with 
various parties. For example, when a business purchases goods on cash basis, cash 
and goods are exchanged between the business and the supplier. Accordingly, a 
transaction can be identified as an exchange of resources between a business and 
other parties.
 In a business, there can be various types of transactions. Among those transactions, 
the transactions of which their value can be measured in terms of money, are 
considered in accounting.
 Examples :-  
   Sales of goods for Rs 100 000
   Monthly salary payment of Rs 50 000
   Obtain a bank loan of to Rs 300 000
   Electricity payment of Rs 5 000 
In addition, to the exchange of resources mentioned above, some events that had 
occurred in businesses are also considered in accounting.  
  Examples :-  
   Damage of  trade stocks - Rs. 10 000
   A trade receivable that becomes a bad debt - Rs. 3 000   
These events are also considered as transactions in a broader sense in accounting.  
Most of the transactions that occur in a business are associated with purchases 
and sales of goods and providing services. Such transactions could be made either 
on cash or credit basis. If the value of the transaction is settled at the point of the 
transaction, it will be considered as a transaction on cash basis. On the other hand, 
if the settlement is made later, it will be considered as a transaction on credit basis.
4.4 Assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses, that  
       arise from various transactions
As a result of transactions following accounting elements arise.
 
    Assets     Equity
    Liabilities      Income and Expenses.
For free distribution50Assets
The resources that are generated as a result of a past transaction are simply called 
assets.
  Examples :-  
   Purchase of a machine by a business
   Purchase of a motor vehicle by a business
In order to recognize an asset in accounting reports, its cost/value should be able 
to be measured reliably. Assets generate future economic benefits to the business. 
  Examples :-    
   If a machine that had been purchased by a business is used to   
   manufacture and sell goods, the cash that flows to the business in   
   future from that machine.
   The profits that are generated by the future sale of purchased stocks.
If any item does not generate future economic benefits, that item cannot be 
considered as an asset. Further, the item should be controlled by the business. This means, the business should be able to use that asset according to the discretion of 
the business and to take decisions on the asset. For example, the above mentioned 
machine and the stock should be able to be used by the business according to the  discretion of the business. A building on a rental basis cannot be considered as an 
asset as it is not controllable by the business.
The following  characteristics are observed of an asset.
          Arose as a result of a past transaction
          Controlled by the business
          Inflow of future economic benefit to the business 
Accordingly, 
       an asset could be defined as follows.
An asset is a resource controlled by the business as a result of a past transaction 
and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the business.
For free distribution51 Examples :-
   Land and buildings, machinery, furniture, equipment, stocks,  
   debtors including receivables, cash at bank, cash in hand.
The assets of a business can be categorised into two types as follows.
   Current Assets
    Non-current Assets
Current Assets
The assets that are expected to be used, sold or converted into cash within a short 
time period as 12 months in the ordinary activities of a business are classified as current assets.
  Examples :- 
   Stocks to be resold, Trade receivable that needs to be   
   recovered within 
12 months.
Non-current Assets
All the assets that cannot be considered as current assets are considered as 
non-current assets. 
  Examples :- 
          Land and buildings, machinery, furniture, equipment, motor vehicles.  
Liabilities
Payables of a business that had arose as a result of  past  transactions could be 
simply considered as liabilities.
 Examples :- 
  A loan obtained from a bank
The business is bound to repay these liabilities in future. Therefore, these are 
considered as current obligations.When these liabilities are settled, the resources which generate future economic benefits (assets) will flow out from the business. Further, in order to show a liability in the accounts, its amount should be able to be measured reliably.
For free distribution52 Example :-  
  In settling a bank loan, it requires to pay cash and cash outflows   
  from the business.
Accordingly, 
         following characteristics are observed of a liability 
  Arose as a result of a past transaction 
  Outflow of economic resources when settlement is made 
  Having a current obligation
 Examples :- 
  Bank loans, Trade creditors
Liabilities also can be categorised into two types as follows.
    Current Liabilities
    Non-current Liabilities 
Current Liabilities
 The liabilities that should be settled within a short period of time as within 12 
months are classified as current liabilities. These are also termed as short-term liabilities. 
  Examples :- 
   Trade creditors that arise when goods are purchased on credit for   
   resale, accrued electricity  expense.
Non-current Liabilities  All of the liabilities that cannot be considered as current liabilities are   
  classified as non-current liabilities.
  Example :-  
   The portion of a bank loan that needs to be settled after one year.
    
 
For free distribution53Equity
If the business has liabilities, a part of its assets has to be used to settle those 
liabilities. After the settlement of such liabilities the assets that remain belongs to 
the owners of the business.
The value of  assets that belongs to owners of the business is termed as equity.
 Example :-  
  Let us assume that a business has Rs. 500 000 worth of assets and a 
  bank loan amounting to Rs. 200 000 .  Rs. 200  000 out of Rs. 500 000
   of assets has to be used to settle the bank loan and therefore, the  
  remaining of assets worth of Rs. 300 000 belongs to the owners.
 
Equity   = Assets   - Liabilities 
   = Rs 500 000  - Rs 200 000
   = Rs 300 000
In a sole proprietorship, the capital invested represents the equity.
Income and Expenses 
Profit of a business is the difference  between income and expenses.
Accordingly,
Profit	 =	 Income 	-	Expenses
            
Profit belongs to the owners of the business. Therefore, profit must be added to the  
equity. Profit can be calculated separately and thereby it can be added to the equity. 
Alternatively, income could be added to the equity and expenses could be deducted 
from the equity. In other words, equity is increased by income and decreased by 
expenses. 
As mentioned above, income belongs to the owners. Therefore, it should be added 
to the equity. As a result, equity increase. However, an increase of equity does not 
occur only from receipt of income. When owners bring additional capital to the 
business it causes to increase the equity. This increase in equity is not considered 
as income.
Therefore, income can be defined as an increase in equity except due to the increases 
from capital introductions by owners.
For free distribution54 Examples :-
  K Sales  
  K Interest received
  K Rent received
  K Commission received
As income belongs to the owners, expenses should also be born by the owners. 
Therefore, expenses should be deducted from the equity and it causes to reduce the equity. However, a decrease of equity does not occur only from expenses. When owners take goods or cash out of the business for their private use (which is termed as drawings), equity decreases. 
Therefore, expenses can be defined as a reduction in equity except due to 
drawings.
 Examples :-
  
K Salaries and wages
  K Insurance expenses
  K Cost of goods sold
  K Interest expenses 
The difference between income and expenses is identified as the profit or loss. If 
it is a profit, it belongs to owners and if it is a loss, owners have to bear that as well. Therefore, profit or loss should be ultimately adjusted to the equity. Then, what remain are assets, liabilities and equity. The relationship among these assets, liabilities and equity could be shown in an equation. This equation is named as the Accounting Equation. You can learn about the accounting equation in the next chapter.

For free distribution585.1  Accounting equation   
The assets and the ownership of those assets of a business are shown in accounting 
records of that business. All assets should belong to some party of the business. 
Therefore, assets of a business should  be equal to the total ownership of those assets. To 
show this relationship, an equation is used, which is called as the Accounting Equation.
5.2  Construction of accounting equation    
If all assets are financed by the owner of the business, the accounting equation can 
be presented as follows.
                                         Assets  =   Equity   
 Example :-  
  Amal started a business investing Rs.500 000 in cash. Here, assets   
  (cash) of the business is equal to Rs. 500 000 and this total amount   
  belongs to the owner, Amal. Accordingly, 
   Assets    =          Equity
     Rs.                 Rs. 
      Cash  500 000   =  Capital 500 000
When a business expands, the resources invested by owners would not be adequate. 
Therefore, the business will have to obtain resources from external parties. When 
the business borrows money, liabilities arise. When there are liabilities in the 
business, a part of its assets belong to debt holders. Remaining of the assets belongs 
to owners. In such a situation, accounting equation can be built as follows.
             Assets  = Equity   + Liabilities
 Example :-
  With reference to the above example, if Amal had obtained a bank   
  loan of Rs. 300 000, assets of Amal's business are increased by   
  Rs. 300 000 (cash). On the other hand, it increases liabilities   
  (bank loan) of the business by Rs. 300 000. 
Accordingly, the accounting equation including the second transaction is now 
depicted as,
      Assets   =    Equity   +          Liabilities
          Rs.                     Rs.            Rs.
  Cash  800 000   =     Capital 500 000   +    Bank loan 300 000
For free distribution595.3 How do business transactions affect the accounting equation
The value of assets, liabilities and equity are changed due to business transactions. 
Accordingly, the accounting equation changes due to the business transactions. Let 
us understand these changes using the following examples.
 Example 1 :-  
  Owner invested Rs. 800 000 as capital.
        Asset   =           Equity   + Liabilities 
           Rs.                   Rs.         Rs.
  Cash 800 000   =            Capital 800 000  +             
 Example 2 :-   
  Purchased furniture for Rs. 100 000.
  The accounting equation changes as follows,
    
   Assets   = Equity   + Liabilities 
      Rs.       Rs.          Rs.
             Furniture  +      Cash  = Capital   + Liabilities

Equation      100 000   +  700 000  = 800 000  +     - 
 Example 3 :-   
   Obtained a bank loan of Rs. 300 000.  
                Assets     = Equity   + Liabilities 
       Rs.       Rs.           Rs.
   Furniture  +  Cash     = Capital   + Bank loan  
Balance at the  100 000    +  700 000  =  800 000  +        -  
beginning   
Bank loan         -       +   300 000  =      -  + 300 000

By studying the above facts, you may have understood the transactions that affect to 
increase or decrease the owner's equity. The following transactions affect to change 
the equity of the business.
 
   Introduction of  additional  capital
   Drawings
   Income
   Expenses
The owner has to invest cash or other assets according to the needs of the business. 
It increases the owners equity.
The owner may withdraw money or other assets from the business for his personal 
use. This is called drawings. It decreases the owner's equity. 
Equity is increased by income and decreased by expenses.

For free distribution706.1 Dual impact of business transactions
Many transactions occur daily in a business. As a result of these transactions, 
the values of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are changed. In 
accounting, these changes are identified as a dual impact of a transaction. As 
explained earlier, each transaction causes change to two items of the accounting 
equation. This is termed as the dual impact of a transaction.
    Examples :- 
Investing Capital Asset (cash) increases Equity increases
Purchase of furniture Asset (furniture ) increases Asset (cash) decrease
Payment of Salary Asset (cash) decreases Equity decreases
                          
Because of this dual impact of each transaction, the value of each transaction 
should be written in two places. This means there should be two entries for each 
transaction. However, when the business expands, a large number of transactions 
could take place. In such a case, recording those transactions in an accounting 
equation may not be practical. Even though we could record those transactions 
in the accounting equation, it is very difficult to obtain information clearly whenever 
necessary. Therefore, the dual impact of transactions are usually recorded in 
accounts according to the double entry system.
6.2 Double entry system
As mentioned above, there is a dual impact of each transaction to the accounting 
equation and this dual impact should be recorded in accounts. When recording the 
dual impact of a transaction, the same amount has to be recorded in two separate 
accounts. Each account has a debit and a credit side. If a value of a transaction 
is debited to a particular account, that value also should be credited to another 
account. The accounting system, which records the same amount in debit and credit 
sides of accounts is called as the double entry system.
6.3 Account
An account is a commonly accepted structure that is used to record the change 
(increase or decrease) of an asset, an equity, a liability, an income or an expense for 
a time period. An account can be prepared as follows. 
    Dr.                         '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''  Account                        Cr.

     the other entry of the transaction.  
(4) and (8)   -    The value of the transaction.
6.4 Types of accounts
We already discussed that assets, equity, liabilities, income and expenses arise due 
to business transactions. Accounts are used to record the changes of assets, equity, 
liabilities, income and expenses due to transactions. All these accounts can be 
classified into five types.
  Asset accounts
Examples :- Building account, Debtors account,   
              Cash account 
  Liability accounts
Examples :- Bank loan account, Creditors   
              account, Electricity expense
          payable account 
  Equity accounts
Examples :- Capital account, Drawings account
 
  Income accounts
Examples :- Sales account, Sales commission   
              income account, Interest income   
              account
  Expenses accounts
Examples :- Salary expense account, Insurance charges  
          account, Electricity expense account
When recording business transactions in accounts, the value of a transaction should 
be either recorded in the debit side or the credit side of the relevant account. Let us 
consider how to record such transactions in accounts.
Figure - 6.1
For free distribution726.5 Recording transactions in accounts
Accounts are debited or credited to show the increase or decrease of assets, equity, 
liabilities, income or expenses due to transactions. However, debiting an account 
does not always mean an increase. To show an increase, some accounts are debited 
and also to show a decrease some accounts are debited. This is same with crediting 
an account. This creates a problem. The problem is to decide what is debited or what 
is credited to show this changes. There are some generally accepted principles in 
accounting which address this problem. These principles are called as the principles 
of  Double Entry. There are five principles for the five types of accounts. They are 
shown in the following table.

The Ledger
A separate account has to be maintained for 
each type of asset. Accordingly, there can be many asset accounts in a business such as motor vehicle account, furniture account, cash account, etc. Similarly, there can be many accounts for each type of equity, liability, income and expenses in a business.  A collection of all accounts is called as the ledger. Therefore, recording business transactions in accounts is also named as recording business transactions in the ledger.

For free distribution787.1  Introduction to prime entry books
There may be issues in recording the business transactions in the ledger accounts 
directly as they take place ' Hence,  before the transactions are recorded in ledger 
accounts, they should be recorded in a separate set of books known as ''the prime 
entry books.'' 
The prime entry books are the books in which the transactions of a business are 
recorded at first, according to the order in which each transaction had occurred by 
using a generally accepted method before recording them in the ledger accounts .
Prime entry books are also named as journals, day books, and subsidiary books.
It is not suitable to record all the transactions in a single prime entry book. Hence, 
the transactions have to be classified and recorded based on their nature and other 
common characteristics. Accordingly, the transactions which are similar in nature 
and occur recurrently should be recorded in different prime entry books.
 
The following table shows various types of transactions and the relevant prime 
entry books in which those transactions should be recorded.

For free distribution797.2  Necessity of prime entry books
The recording of transactions in prime entry books is necessary due to the 
following reasons.
 Y Similar types of transactions of a period need to be classified and  
      recorded.
 Y Posting transactions to the ledger becomes systematical and convenient  
     after recording them in the prime entry book.
 Y Responsibility of preparing each prime entry book can be assigned  
     distinctly to various individuals and accordingly, the business could  
     minimize possible errors and frauds. 
 Y It is easy to maintain the ledger because the totals of prime entry  books  
      are posted to the ledger, which minimizes the number of entries posted.
 Y Minimizes the occurrence of accounting errors and it is easy to find out  
     such errors.
Information of the transactions is obtained from source documents to record 
them in the prime entry books. Therefore, it is important to understand the 
relationship between the prime entry books and the source documents.
 7.3  The source documents
As and when transactions take place in a business, the documents prepared by 
including all the details of such transactions and authorized by a person-in-charge 
are known as source documents. 
Each source document prepared by a business  is assigned a serial number. Source 
documents are used as a basis for recording the transactions in the prime entry 
books of a business. 
Source documents include the following details.
 Y Name and  address of the business

The receipts and payments of cash by the business are recorded in the cash book 
using receipts and payment vouchers respectively as source documents.
Receipts
When a business receives cash the business would issue a document called a 'receipt' 
to the party who gave money to the business, as evidence for such a receipt. 
A serial number in consecutive order is printed on it. Further, this receipt is issued 
with the details such as date of cash receipt, the reason why it was received, the 
amount received and the signature of the cashier. This is also known as the cash 
receipt or cash memo. Receipt is the written evidence of cash received by the 
business. A duplicate of the receipt should be received by the accounts branch and 
it should be used as a source document to record the receipt of cash in the cash 
book. Receipts can be prepared in different formats according to the nature and 
requirement of the business. There is no specific format for a receipt. A business 
could use a receipt that has a general format as indicated below. Please refer them .

For free distribution87Dual function of the cash book
Cash book functions as a prime entry book as business records the receipts and 
payments of cash at first in  the cash book in a sequential order using the receipts and payment vouchers as source documents.    
Cash book also functions as a ledger account as it has both the debit and the credit 
sides. Therefore, cash book performs two functions.
 
Y Performs the function as a prime entry book
 Y Performs the function as a ledger account
Recording of cash transactions
Cash is an asset of the business. The receipt of cash increases assets and the payment 
of cash decreases assets. Therefore, the double entry principle for asset accounts should be applied for recording cash transactions in the cash book.
 Cash received 
- Cash book debit [the rule, the increase of asset - debited]   
 Payment of cash - Cash book credit [the rule, the decrease of asset - credited]
 
Accordingly, all the cash receipts should be debited and all the cash payments 
should be credited in the cash book.
Since the cash book functions as a ledger account, when the business receives cash, 
the debit entry of the double entry for that transaction entered in the cash book. 
Only the credit entry of the relevant account has to be posted in the ledger. Simi-
larly, the payment of cash is credited in the cash book and the credit entry of the double entry entered in the cash book. Only the debit entry of the relevant account has to be posted in the ledger. 
Accordingly,
 
Y  The values that are debited in the cash book should be credited to the  
       relevant accounts in the ledger
 Y  The values that are credited in the cash book  should be debited to the  
       relevant accounts in the ledger

Balancing off the accounts
The value of transactions are debited and credited in the accounts according to 
the principle of double entry. At the end of the period, the difference of the total 
values of debit and credit entries in accounts should be  calculated. This difference 
is known as the balance of the account. Balancing off of an account is required to calculate the balance of that account.
 Example :-
  The total receipt of cash is Rs. 50 000. The total payment of cash  
  is Rs. 33 000. Then the balance of cash is Rs. 17 000. This is 
  considered to be the balance of the cash book.
Examine how the following accounts have been balanced.

A discount can be explained in brief as the deduction of value from the value of a 
transaction (i.e. listed price) when it takes place. Discounts can be classified into 
two main  categories as trade discounts and cash discounts. Discounts are further 
classified as discount received and discount allowed.

Trade Discounts
Most businesses sell goods deducting a certain amount from the listed price. The deduction which was  made from the listed price is called as trade discount. This  
deduction is a trade discount allowed from the point of view of the seller and a trade 
discount received from the buyer's point of view.
The value to be recorded in the sales or the purchase accounts should be the net 
value after deducting the trade discount. Therefore, trade discounts are not recorded 
in accounts. 
 Example :-
  Listed price of goods     = Rs.  20 000
  Trade discount to be deducted  = 10% 
  According to that,
  the value of trade discount: 20 000 x  10 =  Rs. 2 000                                                                                  
             100
  Net value paid after the trade discount =  Rs. 18 000  
This Rs. 18 000 should only be recorded in the accounts.

Cash discounts
Cash discounts come in to being when amounts are received from debtors and 
paid to creditors.
There are certain instances where a condition is included in the invoice to encourage 
the customers to settle their outstanding balances such that a percentage from the outstanding balance would be deducted from the amount due if that amount is paid within a specific period of time set by the business. This amount which is deducted from the amount due is called a cash discount.
 Cash discounts can be classified into two,
  
Y  Discounts allowed
  Y  Discounts received
Discounts allowed
The deduction made on the amount receivable from the debtors, if such amount 
is settled within a time allowed by the business, is called a discount allowed. It is an expense from the point of view of the business. 
Accordingly, since discounts allowed are generated when cash is received from 
debtors, it is easy to record the discount allowed in the cash book. A separate column for discounts allowed is drawn in the debit side of the cash book and discounts allowed are recorded in it. 
For free distribution94Discounts received
Discount received is the amount deducted by the creditors from the amount payable 
to them if it is paid by the business within the time allowed by the creditors. It is an 
income in the point of view of the business. 
Discounts received  are created when creditors are paid. Therefore it is easy to record 
the discount received  in the cash book. Discounts received are recorded in the discount 
received  column, which is separately drawn in the credit side of the cash book.
These discount columns are considered as memorandum columns. These columns 
serve only the purpose of a prime entry book. Since discount columns do not serve the purpose of a ledger account, mere recording a value in them do not complete even one entry of the double entry. Therefore the double entries for these items in the discount 
columns should be entered in the ledger accounts separately.
Recording of discounts in the accounts
The total of the debit side discount column in the cash book should be debited in 
discount allowed account which is opened in the ledger. Debiting of discount allowed 
account conforms to the double entry principle on increase of an expense. Credit 
entries should be made in each of the debtors accounts. This is done because the decrease of asset is credited in that account as per the rules of double entry.
Accordingly, the double entry for discount allowed is,  Discount allowed account  Dr.
  Debtors' accounts   Cr.
The total of credit side discount column in the cash book is credited in the discount 
received account opened in the ledger. Discount received is an income and increase of income is credited according to the double entry rule for income. Debit entries 
for these should be made in each of the creditor's account. This is due to decrease 
of liability should be debited in the liability account.
Therefore, the double entry for the discount received is as followers.  Creditors accounts   Dr.

For free distribution1038.2  Petty Cash Book
Out of the payments made by a business, some of the payments are of small in 
amount and would occur frequently.
 Examples :-
  Payment of cleaning expenses of  Rs. 150
  Payment of postal charges of  Rs. 60
Accordingly, postal charges. cleaning expenses, travelling expenses, entertainment 
expenses and stationery expenses are some examples for the day to day expenses 
of small values.
 The petty cash book is the prime entry book in which the payments of cash  
 with small values that occur frequently are recorded. Petty cash book also  
 functions as a ledger account. Therefore, it also has a dual role like cash book.
The responsibility of maintaining a petty cash book is assigned to a petty cashier, 
who is  under the main cashier. A voucher has to be prepared for each and every 
petty cash payment. It is known as the petty cash voucher. It is the source document 
for the payments to be recorded in the petty cash book.
Petty cash imprest
For purpose of carrying the petty cash payments with a control, a specific amount of 
cash is given to the petty cashier by the main cashier to make petty cash payments, 
which is known as the petty cash imprest. It is the duty of the petty cashier to make 
petty cash payments out of this petty cash imprest as well as and to maintain the 
petty cash book.
Reimbursement of petty cash imprest
The petty cashier has to request again cash from the main cashier before the petty 
cash imprest is over. The petty cashier should be given the amount equivalent to the 
amount of payments made at that time and with that the imprest will be reimbursed. 
This is known as reimbursement of the petty cash imprest. 
 Example :-
        The petty cash imprest of the business of Lihini was Rs. 2 000. The  
        following  payments were made out of this imprest received.
           Rs.
   Stationery expenses       250
   Cleaning expenses       600
   Entertainment expenses     400
   Travelling expenses      350
   Total petty cash expenses   1 600
For free distribution104Accordingly, total petty cash expenses was Rs. 1 600. When the petty cashier 
requests again for cash from the  main cashier, the main cashier will give the petty 
cashier only Rs. 1600, which is the amount spent. This is reimbursement of the 
petty cash imprest.
 Then,
  Petty cash balance in hand          Rs. 400
  Petty expenses reimbursed    Rs. 1 600
  Petty cash imprest     Rs. 2 000
The petty cashier should submit a payment voucher that includes all petty cash 
vouchers to date relevant to the petty cash payments to the main cashier for the 
reimbursement.
           Activity  04

For free distribution105Preparation  of petty cash book
Different columns are maintained to record similar types of payments, so that the 
payments can be posted to the ledger easily. These columns are known as analysis 
columns.
 Examples :-
  Stamp charges, postal charges, purchases of envelops and other  
  similar types of expenses could be identified and recorded in  
  the analysis column named as postal charges.
If any petty cash payments cannot be entered in any of the analysis columns, a 
separate column  known as the sundry expense column could be drawn for such payments. Any other expenses, which cannot be included in any of the analysis 
columns but need to be separately posted to the relevant ledger accounts are 
recorded in the column named as the other ledger account column.
 Examples :-
        Cash paid to creditors, purchase of assets of small value, carriage  inwards.

Like the cash book, the petty cash book also performs a dual function. Accordingly, 
both the functions of a prime entry book and a ledger account is fulfilled by the 
petty cash book.
For free distribution106   As the receipt of petty cash imprest and the payment of 
        petty cash payments are first recorded in the petty cash  
   book, it  performs the task of a book of prime entry.
        Petty cash book also has both debit and credit sides, and 
    entries are recorded according to the principle of double entry 
    for assets. Therefore, it performs the function of a ledger account.
Petty cash transactions are recorded based on the following double entries.
When the petty cash imprest is received and the reimbursement is made,
 Petty Cash book  Debit
   Cash book   Credit
The payments credited in the petty cash book should be debited in the relevant 
ledger accounts. The totals of each analysis column should be posted to the relevant ledger accounts. Accordingly, the double entry is,
   
 Relevant expense account  Debit
 Petty Cash book   Credit
The values recorded in the other ledger account column should be separately debited 
to the relevant ledger accounts.
When the petty cash book is balanced at the end of a time period, the total of the 
debit side is transferred to in the total of the credit column and the difference should 
be brought forward as the b/f balance.

For free distribution1129.1 Bank Account
Most businesses like to conduct cash transactions conveniently and securely by 
opening a current account. The bank account and the cash book are considered as 
asset accounts. Therefore, when the transactions are carried out through the bank 
account, they should be recorded according to the double entry principle for assets. 
Let us understand how the transactions that are conducted through bank current 
account are recorded in a business.
01.  Deposit of cash in the bank
A specified amount of cash has to be deposited to open a current account. In addition, 
cash received by the business would be deposited in the current account. When a 
business deposits cash in the current account, the balance in the current account 
increases and the  cash balance decreases.  
The double entry for deposit of cash is as follows.
 Bank account              Dr.
 Cash book              Cr. 
When depositing cash, a deposit slip has to be completed and submitted along with 
cash to the bank. The bank returns a duplicate of the deposit slip to the business 
(depositor) immediately. This document is used as a source document for the 
recording of the cash deposit.
02.  Deposit of cheques received by the business
Balance in the bank account of the business will increase when cheques are 
deposited. As explained earlier, when cheques from debtors and cash sales are 
received, they are  first debited to the cash book.
 
When these cheques are deposited to the bank later, the double entry should be as 
follows.
 Bank account              Dr.
 Cash book               Cr.
For free distribution113However, if the received cheques are deposited to the bank at the time of receipt, 
instead of debiting to the cash book, they can be directly debited to the bank account 
of the business.
 Example :- 
  The cheque received from the sales amounting to Rs. 10 000 was  
  deposited to the bank account immediately. 
           Then the double entry is, 
  Bank account   Dr. 10 000
           Sales account   Cr. 10 000 
When received cheques are deposited, a cheque deposit slip should be completed 
and submitted to the bank along with the cheques. A duplicate of the deposit slip 
is given to the business (depositor) by the bank. This document is used as a source 
document when the business records the deposited cheque in the bank account of the business. 
Observe the following cheque deposit slip 
 
   Figure 9.1 - A copy of a cheque Deposit Slip
   
For free distribution11403.  Issuing of cheques
Payments can be made to creditors, purchases and expenses by issuing cheques. 
When a cheque is issued, it is a common practice to complete the cheque and its counterfoil, which is the remainder of the cheque leaf in the cheque book. 
Observe the following cheque and its counter foil
Figure 9.2 - A copy of a cheque 
The details of payments made by cheques are recorded in payment vouchers. 
Accordingly, when payments are paid by cheques, the payment voucher is used as the source document to record such transactions in the bank account of the business.
When payments are made by cheques, the balance in the bank account of the 
business decreases.  
Accordingly,  The relevant double entry is as follows.
 Expense account or the relevant payment account       Dr.
 Bank account          Cr.
04. Dishonouring of cheques
There are situations where a bank refuses cheques due to cheques being written 
disorderly, insufficient balance in the current account, signature on the cheque is different from the specimen signature, etc. This is known as dishonouring of cheques. 
Accordingly, cheques deposited as well as cheques issued may be dishonoured by 
the bank. A cheque return notification is sent by the bank to the business to inform 
about dishonoured cheques.
For free distribution115Observe the following copy of the cheque return notification.
Figure 9.3 - A copy of a Cheque Return Notification 
For free distribution116Dishonouring of  Deposited Cheques 
When cheques are received from cash sales, debtors, etc. and when those cheques 
are deposited in the bank, they are debited  to the bank account of the business. This 
is because the balance in the bank account is increased. However, when a cheque 
is dishonored by the bank, in fact, the bank balance does not increase. Therefore, when a deposited cheque is dishonored, the debit entry made in the bank account of 
the business should be reversed. Here, the value of the dishonored cheque should 
be cancelled from the bank account and should be recorded as a receivable from the party who had given the cheque. Accordingly, the double entry for the dishonoured 
deposited cheque should be recorded as follows
 Debtors/Relevant account Dr.
 Bank account    Cr.
 Example :- 
  A cheque received from a debtor for Rs. 8 000 and deposited in   
  the bank had been dishonoured by the bank. The double entry for   
  recording of this dishonoured cheque is as follows.            
  Debtor's account   Dr. 8 000
             Bank account    Cr. 8 000
Dishonouring of  issued cheques
It is already discussed that when cheques are issued, the relevant expense account 
or other relevant account should be debited and the bank account should be 
credited. When such an issued cheque is dishonoured by the bank, entries that were originally recorded should be reversed. This is done  by a reversal entry to the entry 
that was recorded originally when the cheque was issued. Accordingly, when an 
issued cheque is dishonoured it should be recorded as follows. 
 Bank account      Dr. 
 Expense account/Relevant other account  Cr.
 Example :- 
  A cheque issued by the business to a creditor of Rs. 15 000 was   
  dishonoured when presented to the bank.
When this information is received, the double entry for this dishonored cheque is as follows.
   Bank account    Dr. 15 000
  Creditors account   Cr. 15 000
 Example :- 
  Nethmi's business had the following balances as at 01.06.20xx

For free distribution120Bank overdraft
There are situations where banks allow their customers to issue cheques for more 
than the existing balance in their current accounts. This facility is known as a bank 
over draft. If the business issues cheques exceeding the existing bank balance, the 
total of the credit side of the bank account of the business exceeds the total of the debit side of the bank account. As a result, a credit balance appears in the bank 
account. This credit balance of the bank account is known as bank overdraft, which 
is considered as a liability of the business. Accordingly, when cheques are issued in excess of the existing bank balance and when the bank makes payment on them, 
the account holder becomes a debtor to the bank and that debit balance in the bank 
is known as the bank overdraft.
 Example :- 
  There was a favourable balance (debit balance) in the bank account  
  of Samadhi's business of Rs 12 000 as at 01.07.20xx. Following  
  transactions took place during the month of July.

Rs. 56 000 and the total of the debit side is Rs. 42 000. There is a deficit of Rs. 14 000 in 
the debit side than the credit side. As a result, a credit balance of Rs. 14 000 appears 
in the bank account. This is the bank overdraft. This is a liability as the business has 
to pay it back to the bank.

For free distribution1229.2  Bank  reconciliation statement
You have already studied how the transactions are recorded in the bank account 
wich are carried out through the current account of a business. The favorable balance 
of the bank account of a business is an asset to the business. Transactions should 
be recorded in the bank account according to the double entry principle for assets. 
The transactions which increase the balance in the bank account are debited and the 
transactions which decrease the bank balance should be credited to the bank account.
Now let us study how transactions are recorded in the books of a commercial bank  
which maintains  a current account on behalf of a business. The bank also records in 
its own books the transactions of the business operated through the current account 
by a business. The account that is maintained by the bank of the business is treated 
as a liability account of the bank. Therefore, the bank records the transactions of 
the business according to the double entry principle for liabilities. Accordingly, the 
transactions that increase the bank balance should be credited and the transactions 
that decrease the bank balance should be debited.  
Accordingly, let us study how a bank has recorded few bank transactions of a 
business in its books. See the statement below.

The values which are debited in the bank account that is maintained by the business 
are  credited by the bank in the account maintained by the bank. The values which 
are credited by the business in the bank account are debited by the bank in the 
account. Finally, if there is a debit balance in the bank account maintained by the 
business, there will be a credit balance in the bank account maintained by the bank 
for the business.
For free distribution123Bank Statement
Usually, banks send a statement called a bank statement to their current account 
holders once a month. The bank statement shows the opening balance, items which are debited and credited by the bank during the month and the closing balance.
At present, banks send a computer printout to the business that holds a current 
account. The statement that is sent by the bank is known as the bank statement or the statement of accounts. 
Examine the following bank statement carefully. 
Figure 9.4 - A copy of a bank statement
For free distribution124The bank account of the business shows the cash at the bank when balancing off  
its bank account. The bank statement sent by the bank shows the money at bank 
of the business according to the books of the bank. If both parties had recorded all transactions related to the current account, these two balances should be similar. 
However, in practice, the bank account balance of the business and the balance in the 
bank statement may differ. The reason for this difference is that certain transactions which have been recorded in the bank account are not recorded in the bank statement 
and certain other transactions recorded in the bank statement are not recorded in the 
bank account of the business.
The reasons for the difference between the final balance of the bank 
account and the final balance of the bank statement
 
01. The cheques issued but not presented to the bank for payment
When a business issues cheques, they are credited to the bank account. Then, the 
balance of the bank account maintained by business decreases. There are instances 
where some of these cheques issued by the business may have not been presented 
to the bank for encashment  even at the end of the period. These are known as the cheques issued but not presented or as unpresented cheques. Since the bank has not 
paid for these cheques, they are not recorded as payments in the bank statement.
 Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the business should be less   
 than the balance in  the bank statement.
02. The cheques deposited but not realised
When received cheques are deposited in the bank, the bank account of the business 
should be debited. Then, the balance in the bank account increases. Some of these cheques that were deposited may have not been realised by the end of the time period. Realisation of cheques refers to the process that the amount mentioned in the cheque has been collected and added to the current account in the bank. It would take few days for the amount of the cheque to be collected and added to the balance in the bank current account. Therefore, it is possible that the bank has not recorded the value of the cheques deposited in the books of the bank even at the end of  the relevant time period. These cheques are identified as the cheques deposited but not realised. Therefore, cheques deposited but not yet realized are not recorded as deposits in the bank statement.
 Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the business should be higher   
  than the balance in the bank statement.

For free distribution12503. Direct remittances
There are  occasions when some customers deposit their dues directly to the current 
account at the bank. Similarly receivables such as rent,  interest and dividends, etc.,  
are sometimes directly remitted to the current account. These are known as direct 
remittances. A business realizes such direct remittances after the receipt of the bank statement. Although, such direct deposits have been recorded as reciepts in the 
bank statement they have not been recorded in the bank account of the business. 
 Therefore, the bank account balance of the business is less than the balance  
 in the bank statement.
04. Payments on standing orders
Standing orders refers to an order made to the bank in writing by the business  to 
pay certain regular amounts such as repayment of instalments of bank loans, leasing 
instalments, insurance premiums and other similar payments from the cash in the 
current account. The business gets to know of these payments, after recieving the bank statement. The bank deducts (debits) the value from the current account after 
payment of such standing orders. Although the payments on standing orders have 
been deducted (debited) in the bank statement, these have not been added (credited) in the bank account yet.
 Therefore, the balance in the bank account of the business is higher than the  
  balance in the bank statement. 
05. Bank charges and the charges on cheque book
The charges that a bank deducts from the current account for the services rendered 
by the bank to the current account holder is known as bank charges. The amount 
charged for the cheque books issued by a bank to the business is called charges 
for cheque books. The business realizes know these charges after the receipt of the bank statement. These charges have been debited in the bank statement as 
payments. They have not been recorded in the bank account of the business by the 
end of the time period.
 Therefore, the balance of the bank account of the  business should be higher  
 than the balance in the bank statement.
The final balance of the bank account of the business and the final balance in the 
bank statement may differ due to the above stated reasons.
The reasons for the difference between these balances can be identified only after 
the comparison of the bank account of the business and the bank statement sent by the bank. Accordingly, the reasons for the difference should be identified first by 
comparing the bank account and the bank statement.

For free distribution126For that, 
     Debit column of the bank account should be compared with the credit column 
          of the bank statement
     Credit column of the bank account should be compared with the debit 
        column of the bank statement.
Therefore, each value in the bank account should be checked to see whether those 
values have been included in the bank statement. The items which have been recorded in both should be marked. The items remaining unmarked in both the bank 
account and the bank statement are the items which have been recorded only in one 
of the books. Those unmarked items are the reasons for the difference between the 
two final balances . An understanding of this can be obtained through the following 
exercise.

The Reasons for this difference are,
 01. When the debit side of the bank account and the credit column  
        of the bank statement are compared,
     Cheque deposited but not realised was (Cheque No. 58) Rs. 14 000.
     A direct remittance to the current account in the bank by a debtor was 
         Rs. 11 000.
For free distribution128 02. When the credit side of the bank account and the debit side of   
        the bank statement are compared.
         Unpresented cheque to the bank (Cheque No. 114) was Rs. 16 000. 
         The payment on standing order for bank loan instalment not 
  recorded in the bank account was Rs. 18 000.
         Bank charges not recorded in the bank account was Rs. 3 000. 
To adjust and compare these reasons, two steps have to be followed. They are,
 01. Adjusting the bank account balance of the business.
 02. Preparation of bank reconciliation statement based on the adjuste d   
       bank balance obtained under Step 1 above.
Adjusting the bank account balance of the business
Among the reasons that have caused a difference  between the bank account balance 
and the current account balance, there may be some errors or omissions  in the bank account of the business.
Due to these errors or ommissions, the bank account balance becomes incorrect. 
Therefore, the bank account balance should be adjusted. This is known as adjusting 
of the balance of the bank account of the business.
According to the above example, values of the following causes should be adjusted 
in the bank account of the business.  
 01. Direct remittances (Debtors' remittance)
 02. Standing order (Bank loan instalment)
 03. Bank charges
The bank account balance should increase by the 
receipt of the direct remittance. Therefore, the direct remittance should be debited to the bank account of the business.
Payment on the standing order and charges made by  
the bank should decrease the bank balance. Therefore, the payment on the standing order and charges should be credited to the bank account of the business. We get the adjusted balance of the bank account after these  
 adjustments.  
Based on this example, the bank account of the business is adjusted as follows.

Preparation of the bank reconciliation statement using the adjusted balance of 
the bank account
After adjusting the bank account, if the adjusted balance of the bank account is not 
similar to the balance of the bank statement, following will be the main reasons for the difference.
Y  The values of the cheques which have been deposited but not realised
Y  The values of the cheques which have been  issued but not presented to the bank    
     for payment 
However, the above two reasons are not errors or omissions and therefore, the 
bank account balance is not adjusted. Therefore, a statement should be prepared  
including the above two reasons to reconcile between the balance of the adjusted 
bank account and balance of the bank statement. This statement is identified as the bank reconciliation statement. By the preparation of the bank reconciliation 
statement, the accuracy of the balances can be ensured.
   Accordingly,
   The bank account balance is less than the balance of the bank 
statement due to the cheques which have been issued  
but not presented to the bank for payment. Therefore, the 
cheques which have not been presented to the bank should be shown as an addition to the adjusted bank balance in the 
bank reconciliation statement. 
The bank account balance is higher than the balance of 
the bank statement due to the cheques which have been 
deposited but have not been realised within that period. Therefore, the cheques deposited but not realised should 
be shown as a deduction from the adjusted bank balance in 
the bank reconciliation statement.
The balance we get after preparing the bank reconciliation  statement including the 
above two reasons should be the balance mentioned in the bank statement.
Let us see how the bank reconciliation statement is prepared using the adjusted 
bank account balance based on the example given earlier.

Businesses purchase goods with the objective of reselling. These goods are pur -
chased either on cash basis or on credit basis. Goods purchased on credit basis are 
recorded in a separate record named as the Purchases Journal. This is also known 
as the Purchases Day Book.
The purchases of trade goods on credit basis are initially recorded in the Purchase Journal.
  Example :-
  If a business buys and resells stationeries ,the purchase of stationeries   
            on the credit basis is recorded in the Purchases Journal.  
  If a business buys and resells automobiles, the purchase of auto   
  mobiles on credit basis is recorded in the Purchase Journal.
When purchasing goods on credit basis, the parties providing goods are known 
as suppliers or trade creditors. The amount payable to creditors are liabilities of 
a business. Suppliers, when providing goods on credit, prepare and send a source 
document including information about supply. This source document is the ‘invoice’. 
In the perspective of the purchasing business, it is the purchase invoice. The 
information in the purchase invoice is required to be recorded in the Purchases 
Journal at first. Thereafter, those transactions are posted into the ledger later.

When a business sells trading goods on credit, such transactions are first recorded 
in the Sales Journal.
When selling trading goods on credit, an invoice is issued to debtors. This document 
is known as the sales invoice. The business retains a copy of the sales invoice. This 
sales invoice is the source document for recording transactions in the Sales Journal.
  
The price mentioned in the invoice may also be reduced by a certain percentage 
when selling on a credit basis. This reduction is the trade discount. The net value 
after deducting this trade discount is recorded in the Sales Journal.
The  transactions recorded in the Sales Journal are posted into the ledger periodically.

  The following invoices with net values are issued by    
  Amarasinghe’s Business which buys and sells consumer goods.

10.3 General Journal
The earlier chapters and above sections discussed how to record day-to-day transac -
tions of a business in the Cash Book, Petty Cash Book, Purchase Journal and Sales 
Journal. These  journals are used to record only one type of transaction. Hence, 
they are known as specialized journals. 
 Example :-
  Sales Journal is used to record only credit sales of trade goods.
There may be some other transactions other than the transactions recorded in 
those journals. These transactions cannot be recorded in these journals.
 
 Examples :-
  K Purchase of a machine on credit basis to be used in the business. 
  K Purchase of a land on credit basis to expand the business activities.
  K Owner uses goods of the business for his own purpose.
These transactions should be recorded in a separate prime entry book. The prime 
entry book used to record these transactions is known as the General Journal. 
Accordingly, transactions that are not recorded in other prime entry books  are 
recorded at first in the General Journal.
The source document used in recording transactions in the General Journal is the 
journal voucher. A General Journal can be prepared as follows.

For free distribution14811.1  Introduction to trial balance
When preparing ledger accounts based on the double entry principles, the value 
of a transaction is recorded in the debit side of one account and in the credit side 
of the other relevant account. As a result of this, after balancing off the ledger 
accounts, there are debit and credit balances. If the transactions are recorded and 
ledger accounts are balanced correctly  the totals of debit and credit balances should 
be equal. The list which is prepared at the end of the period by including all the 
debit and credit balances of ledger accounts is called as the trial balance. The trial 
balance is not an account. It is merely a list of balances and could be considered as 
a summary of the ledger. 
If the debit and credit entries have been recorded correctly in ledger accounts and 
those accounts have been balanced correctly, the total of the debit column of the 
trial balance should agree with the total of the credit column of the trial balance.
If the trial balance agrees, following two facts can be confirmed.
    1. The values debited to the accounts are equal to the values credited to the accounts
      2. Ledger accounts have been balanced correctly (i.e. there is mathematical accuracy).

 12.2   The occasions when accounting errors occur
  12.3  Identification of accounting errors
             12.4  Errors that do not affect the agreement of trial balance
  12.5  Accounting errors that affect the agreement of the trial balance

For free distribution15812.1   The need to correct accounting errors
Accounting is expected to provide accurate information to stakeholders in making 
decisions. However, errors may occur when business transactions are recorded in 
prime entry books, posted to the ledger, balancing the ledger accounts as well as 
when extracting accounting balances for the trial balance. If such errors had occurred 
in the accounting process, correct information cannot be provided to the stakeholders 
to make decisions. Therefore, such errors should be corrected before the financial 
statements are prepared. 
12.2 The occasions when accounting errors may occur
The occasions when accounting errors may occur is stated below.
01. When transactions are recorded in the prime entry books
Errors may occur when recording transactions in prime entry books.
 Examples :-
  A sales invoice of Rs. 20 000 of credit sales has not been recorded in  
  the sales journal.
  A purchase invoice of Rs. 50 000 has been entered erroneously as   
  Rs. 5 000 in the purchases journal.
02. When the transactions are posted to the ledger from the prime   
       entry books
Errors may occur when transactions are posted to the ledger accounts.
 Examples :-
  The total of the purchases journal that amounts to Rs. 50 000 has   
  not been posted to the purchases account. 
  The total of the sales journal that amounts to Rs. 155 000 has been   
  entered erroneously as Rs. 150 000 in the sales account.
03. When balancing of ledger accounts
Errors may arise when balancing ledger accounts at the end of the period.
 Examples :-
  Total of the sales account has been totalled less by Rs. 10 000
  Total of the rent account is overstated by Rs. 5 000
For free distribution15904. When the trial balance is prepared
Errors may occur in the preparation of the trial balance using the balances of the 
ledger accounts. 
 Examples :-
  The balance of the electricity bill account of  Rs. 15 000 has not  
  been extracted to the trial balance.
  The balance of the insurance account of  Rs. 10 000 has been 
  entered as Rs. 1 000 in the trial balance.
Errors may occur in this way at different stages in the accounting process. There -
fore, as the first step, a business should identify such errors.
12.3  Identification of accounting errors
Transactions of a business are recorded according to the double entry principle. 
Accordingly, every debit entry should have a corresponding credit entry. As a result, 
the total of the debit column should be equal to the total of the credit column of the 
trial balance prepared by the business. 
If both the totals are not equal, it is an indication that errors have occurred in the 
accounting process. However, even if the totals agree, still there might be errors. 
Hence, the agreement of credit and debit balances in the trial balance only 
confirms that similar value of debits have been recorded as credits and the accounts 
are balanced. 
Accordingly, accounting errors can be categorized in to two.
 Y Errors that do not affect the agreement of the trial balance
 Y Errors that affect the agreement of the trial balance
Accordingly, errors should be corrected using the general journal. Thereafter, the 
erroneous ledger accounts need to be corrected.
Now, let us study how each of the errors mentioned above is corrected.
 
For free distribution16012.4  Errors that do not affect the agreement of trial balance
Some errors that occur in the accounting process might not affect the agreement of 
the trial balance. Therefore, even if such errors had occurred, the total of the debit 
column would be equal to the total of the credit column of the trial balance. These 
errors are also known as "the errors that are not revealed by the trial balance." 
Examples for such errors are stated below.
01.  A complete ommission of a transaction from the books
If a particular transaction is not recorded in the prime entry book, such a transaction  
would not be entered in the ledger accounts as well. These errors are known as 
"errors of omission." The double entry of the omitted transaction should be entered 
properly in the relevant ledger accounts to correct this error.
 Example :-
  An invoice of credit purchase Rs. 50 000 has been completely   
  omitted from the accounting books.
The above error is corrected as,

50 000
02.  Recording incorrect value of a transaction in the prime entry   
       books
This refers to recording lesser or higher than the correct value of the transaction 
in the prime entry books. Then, both the values entered as debit and credit entries 
have the erroneous value. However, there is no impact on the agreement of the 
trial balance because both the values recorded as debits and credits are the same.
Therefore, recording the difference between the correct and incorrect value that 
was recorded is sufficient to correct the error.
For free distribution161 Example :-
  A credit sales invoice of Rs. 20 000 has been recorded as Rs. 2 000  
  in error in the sales journal. 
Here, both the debtor's account and the sales account have been understated by 
Rs. 18 000 (Rs. 20 000 - Rs. 2 000) and therefore, both accounts should be corrected by recording Rs. 18 000. The journal entry to correct this error is as follows.

       as Rs. 1 300 in the discount received column of the cash book. 
Here, both creditors and the discount received accounts have been recorded less 
by Rs. 200 (Rs. 1 500 - Rs. 1 300) and should be adjusted in both accounts.

03. Recording same transaction twice in the accounting books
Sometimes, a transaction might have been recorded twice in the prime entry books, and 
accordingly, posted to ledger accounts twice. This error can be corrected by reversing the additional entry with the value of the transaction in both of the relevant accounts. 
 Example :-
  Purchase invoice of Rs. 10 000 on credit has been entered twice in 
  the books.

04. Recording the value of a transaction in an incorrect account instead        
of the relevant account
There are occasions when the value of a transaction is recorded in an incorrect 
account instead of the relevant account. However, there is no impact on the agreement 
of the trial balance due to this error, as the same value had been recorded as both 
debit and credit entries. 
 Example :-
  Office equipments that had been purchased for the business use for  
   Rs. 200 000 is debited in the purchases account.
The purchases account shows the value of the goods bought for the purpose of resale 
by the business. Here, the office equipment were purchased only for the business use, 
and therefore, it should be debited to the asset account known as the office equipment 
account.

An apprentice bookkeeper has prepared a trial balance on 31-12-20xx and says 
that it is not necessary to check again the accounts as both the balances of debit 
and credit columns of the trial balance agree, as well as the final accounts can be 
prepared correctly.
Comment on the above statement.
                Activity 02
Even though the totals of the trial balance prepared by a business as at 31-12-20xx 
agree, the following errors were identified subsequently.
 i.   A purchase invoice of Rs. 20 000 has been completely omitted from the  
      books of accounts.
 ii.  A computer bought for office use to the cost of Rs. 40 000 has been   
           debited to the purchases account.
 iii.Payment of electricity charges of Rs. 5 000 has been erroneously 
                debited to the Insurance charges account.
 iv. Withdrawals of goods worth of Rs. 12 000 by the owner for his own   
           use has not been recorded in the books.
 Required: 
  Write the necessary journal entries to correct of the above errors.
12.5  Accounting errors that affect the agreement of the   
         trial balance
A difference would arise between the total of debit and credit columns of a trial 
balance due to certain errors that had occurred in the process of accounting. These 
errors are known as the errors which affect the agreement of the trial balance. The 
ledger accounts should be checked to identify what such errors are. However, it 
would take a considerable amount of time to detect such errors. Therefore, such  a 
difference should be posted to a suspense account until those errors are identified 
and corrected.
For free distribution164Suspense account
When there is a difference between the totals of debit and credit balances in the trial 
balance, that difference should  be recorded temporarily into an account called the 
Suspense account until such errors are identified and corrected.
A suspense account is created in the following way.   i. Identify the difference between the totals of the debit and credit balances   
      of the trial balance.
  ii. Insert that difference on the side where the deficit exists in the trial   
      balance and balance the trial balance. 
 iii. As the reason for this shortage is not known yet write the words 
     "Suspense account" in front of the difference in the trial balance.
 iv. Then, record the value of the shortage in a separate Suspense account.
Accordingly, if a difference exists on the credit column of the trial balance, record 
such difference on the credit side of the suspense account. On the other hand, if the 
difference exists on the debit column of the trial balance insert such difference on 
the debit side of the suspense account. 
The trial balance as at 31
st of December 20xx of Janaka's business is given below. 
It has been balanced temporarily by writing Suspense account in front of the 
difference of the trial balance.

Following are the totals of the debit and the credit balances of the trial balance 
prepared as at 31.03.20xx for Naveen's business.
Total of the debit column  -  Rs. 545 000
Total of the credit column -  Rs. 520 000
Find the value of the difference and record it in a suspense account.
Correction of accounting errors that affect the agreement of trial 
balance
The reason or reasons for the difference in the trial balance should be identified 
after recording the difference in a suspense account. Therefore, certain entries have 
to be made in the suspense account to correct the  errors. The suspense account will 
be eliminated  from the books of accounts after the correction of all accounting errors 
that affect the agreement of the trial balance. Therefore, when such errors are 
corrected one of the double entries for the correction should be entered in the 
suspense account. 
Let us now consider the errors that are revealed by the trial balance and how such 
errors are corrected.
 
01. Omission of one entry from books
 Example :-
  Payment of telephone charges of Rs. 15 000 has been recorded  
  only in the cash book.
For free distribution166Here, the relevant value is not debited to the telephone 
charges account. Therefore, the telephone charges 
account should be debited to correct this error. On the 
other hand, the cash book is already credited correctly. The total of the debit column of the trial balance is less by Rs. 15 000 due to this error. As a result, a debit 
balance of Rs. 15 000 appears in the suspense
account. Accordingly, the relevant general journal 
entry to correct this error is shown below, credit entry of Rs. 15 000 should be made to correct this in the suspense account.

02. Making one of the double entries with the correct value and the other      
      entry with the incorrect value of a transaction.
 Example :-
         Cash sales for Rs. 54 000 has been debited in the cash book correctly   
         and has been credited incorrectly as Rs. 45 000 in the sales account. 
Here, the sales account has been credited less of Rs. 9 000. 
Due to crediting Rs. 9 000 less in the sales account, the total of credit column of the trial balance is Rs. 9 000 
less and a balance of Rs. 9 000 would appear in the 
credit side of the suspense account. To correct the error, 
the suspense account should be debited with Rs. 9 000 
and the sales account should be credited Rs. 9 000. By 
doing this, the suspense account will be removed.Figure 12.1

03. Recording of the double entries of a transaction in the same side of         
      the accounts
Both the entries of a transaction may have been entered in the same side of the accounts in error.
 Example :-
       Cash received from the debtors of Rs. 5 000 has been debited to both  
          the cash book and the debtor's account.
Due to the above error, each account has been debited 
by Rs. 5 000. No account has been credited. Therefore, the total of the credit column of the trial balance is 
understated by Rs. 10 000. Therefore, the suspense 
account has a credit balance of Rs. 10 000. Accordingly, Rs. 10 000 should be debited to cancel the suspense 
account. Rs. 5 000 should be credited to the debtor's 
account to cancel the amount debited incorrectly. In addition, Rs. 5 000 should be credited to the debtor's 
account to correct the error. Accordingly, the debtors 
account should be credited a total of Rs. 10 000 to correct the error. The general journal entry is shown 
below.

 Example :-
  The correct total of the purchases account of  Rs. 25 000 has been   
  erroneously totalled  posted as Rs. 5 000 in the purchases account.
The total of the debit column of the trial balance is 
Rs. 20 000 less due to the shortage of Rs. 20 000 in the purchase account. Therefore, the suspense account has a debit balance of Rs. 20 000. Rs. 20 000 should be credited to the suspense account to cancel this balance. The purchase account should be debited by Rs. 20 000 to correct the purchase account as it is understated by Rs. 20 000.

05. Errors that arise when preparing the trial balance
Although all ledger accounts are correct, there is the possibility  of errors to occur when preparing the trial balance.
 Following errors may occur when preparing the trial balance,
 Y  Certain accounts balances have not been extracted to the trial balance
 Y  Entering incorrect values of account balances in the trial balance
 Y  Entering value of account balances to the incorrect column of the trial balance
Errors that occur when the trial balance is prepared have a special feature in correc-
tion when compared with other errors. Here, no error has occurred in the relevant  ledger accounts. The errors had occurred only in the trial balance. Therefore, correction of ledger accounts is not required. Nevertheless, the difference in the totals of the trial balance have to be recorded in the suspense account.

For free distribution169       Example :-
      The balance in the building rent expense account of Rs. 10 000 has  
      not been extracted to the trial balance. 
Here, as there is no impact on the building rent expense account, it is not necessary to correct it. 
However, the suspense account has a debit balance 
due to the debit column of the trial balance being 
understated by Rs. 10 000. Therefore, the error of understatement can be cancelled by crediting Rs. 10 000 to the suspense account and entering the building rent expense account to the trial balance.

When correcting errors that affect the agreement of the trial balance, one entry is recorded in the suspense ac-count and the other entry is recorded in the relevant led-ger account.However, when correcting the errors which do not affect the agreement of the trial balance, only the two accounts which are affected should be identified and corrected, and no entries are required in the suspense account.

The following accounting errors have been identified,
01. The balance of the electricity bill account of Rs. 16 000 has not been extracted 
      to the trial balance.
02. The balance of the interest income account of  Rs. 10 000 has been entered in 
      the debit column of the trial balance.
03. Repayment of bank loan of  Rs. 30 000 has been recorded only in the cash book.
04. The balance of the purchases account of Rs. 130 000 has been entered in the 
       trial balance as Rs. 150 000 in error.
05. The drawings account has been balanced erroneously as Rs. 34 000, instead of  
      the correct value of Rs. 43 000.
The correction of above errors of Kasuni's business can be explained as follows.
01. The total of debit column of the trial balance has been understated by Rs. 16 000  
      due to not entering the balance of the electricity bill account. Therefore, 
      Rs. 16 000 should be included in the debit column of the trial balance and   
      credited to the suspense account.        
For free distribution171 02. Interest income account is an income account and should be shown on the         
       credit column of the trial balance. Therefore, the credit column total of the   
       trial balance is in short of Rs. 20 000 because of entering the interest income   
        account balance of Rs. 10 000 in the debt column of the trial balance. Accordingly,  
        Rs. 20 000 should be entered in the credit column of the trial balance and the  
        suspense account should be debited with this value.
03. When the part of the bank loan is repaid, the bank loan account should be debited.   
       However, the bank loan account is not debited with repayment of Rs. 30 000.         
       Accordingly, the bank loan account is overstated by Rs. 30 000. Further, as a           
       result, the credit column of the trial balance is overstated by Rs. 30 000 and is  
       therefore included in the suspense account. Therefore, to correct this error,  
      the bank loan account should be debited and the suspense account should be         
       credited with Rs. 30 000.04. The total of the debit column of the trial balance is overstated by Rs. 20 000  
      due to entering the purchase account balance as Rs. 150 000 instead  of the  
       correct value of Rs. 130 000. This error has to be corrected.    
05. The total of the debit column of the trial balance has been understated by 
       Rs. 9 000 due to the understatement in the drawings account by Rs. 9 000.         
       Therefore, Rs. 9 000 should be credited to the suspense account and debited    
       to the drawings account.
