viiiMessage of the Board of Compilers
This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be 
implemented from 2015. 
Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to 
compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to 
read and understand it on your own. 
We have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject 
concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are 
organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. 
We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the 
glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official 
Languages.
Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject 
content in the grade 10 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin -
ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them 
for the subject content of grade 10.
You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and do -
ing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in 
the classroom.
We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful  and productive 
experience.

BThe	region	which	is	shaded	in	this	figure	is	a	portion	of	a	
circle	with	centre	 C	which	is	bounded	by	two	radii	and	a	
part	of	the	circumference.	 Such	a	portion	is	called	a	
sector of a circle . The	angle	θ   which	is	the	angle	
between	the	two	radii	is	called	the	 angle at the centre .
The	angle	at	the	centre	can	take	any	value	from	0o	to	360o.

1.1 Finding the arc length of a sector of a circle
θr
CArc	length
The	figure	illustrates	a	sector	of	a	circle	of		radius	 r.	Such	a	sector	is	called	a	sector	
of	radius	 r	and	angle	at	the	centre	 θ. Let	us	now	consider	how	the	arc	length	of	such	
a	sector	of	a	circle	is	found.  
Let	us	first	find	the	arc	length	of	a	semi-circle	of	radius	 r.
We	know	that	the	circumference	of	a	circle	of	radius	 r	is	2πr.	
Therefore,	due	to	symmetry,	the	arc	length	of	a	semi-circle	of	radius	 r is	given	by
     
Here,	the	reason	for	taking	the	arc	length	of	the	semi-circle	 to	be	πr,	that	is,	the	
value	of	2πr	divided	by	2,	is	the	symmetry	 of	the	circle.	The	expression	 πr for	
the	arc	length	of	a	semi-circle	 of	radius	 r	can	be	obtained	by	reasoning	out	in	the	
following	manner	too.
Let	us	consider	a	circle	and	a	semi-circle,	both	of	radius	 r.  
r
C
360x 
The	angle	at	the	centre	of	the	circle	is	360o.	The	arc	length	
corresponding	 to	this	angle	is	the	circumference	 of	the	circle	
which	is	2 πr.
Now	let	us	consider	the	semi-circle.
r r180xThe	angle	at	the	centre	of	the	semi-circle	 is	180o,	which	is	  of	
360o.	Therefore,	 the	arc	length	of	the	semi-circle	 should	be	 of	
the	arc	length	of	the	circle.

4 That	is,	the	arc	length	of	the	semi-circle	is	
Writing	this	in	more	detail,  
 the	arc	length	of	the	semi-circle   
In	the	same	manner,	since	the	angle	at	the	centre	is	90o	for	a	sector	which	is of	
the	circle,  
 r
Cr  arc	length   of	a	sector	which	is	  of	the	circle	
Reasoning	 out	in	this	manner,	an	expression	 can	easily	be	obtained	for	the	arc	
length	of	a	sector	of	a	circle	of	radius	 r	with	angle	at	the	centre	 θ x.

sector	of	a	circle.

Observe	the	1st	and	2nd	columns	of	the	table.	If	the	length	of	the	arc	of	the	circle	can	
be	identified	from	the	figure	as	a	fraction	of	the	circumference,	 then	the	length	of	
the	arc	can	easily	be	found.	When	the	angle	at	the	centre	is	in	degrees,	this	fraction

To	obtain	the	perimeter	of	a	sector	of	a	circle,	the	arc	length	and	the	lengths	of	the	
two	radii	by	which	the	sector	is	bounded	should	be	added	together.

the	perimeter	of	a	sector	of	a	circle	of	radius	 r	with	angle	at	the	centre	 θ x
   
    is

By studying this lesson you will be able to
•  approximate the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square
•	use	the	division	method	to	find		an	approximate	 value	for	the	square	root	of	a	
positive number which is not a perfect square.
 2.1 The square root of a positive number
You	have	earlier	learnt	some	facts	about	the	square	of	a	number,	and	the	square	root	
of	a	positive	number.	Let	us	briefly	recall	what	you	have	learnt.	
The	value	of	3	«	3	is	9.		We	denote	3	«	3	in	short	by	32.  This is read as ‘three 
squared’.		 The	‘2’	in	32		denotes	the	fact	that	two	threes	are	multiplied		 ‘twice’	over.
Accordingly,	three	squared	is	9	and	this	can	be	written	as	32	=	9.
The	squares	of	several	numbers	are	given	in	the	following	table.
Number How the square of the 
number is obtainedHow the square 
of the number is 
denotedSquare of the 
number
1   1 × 1  121
2   2 × 2 224
3   3 × 3 329
4   4 × 4 4216
5   5 × 5 5225
Numbers	such	as	1,	4,	9,	16	are	perfect	squares.
Finding	the	square	root	is	the	inverse	of	squaring.	 For	example,	 since	32	=	9,	we	say	
that	the	square	root	of	9	is	3.	It	will	be	clear	to	you,	according	 to	the	first	and	last	
columns	of	the	above	table	that	
	 	 						the	square	root	of	1	is	1,
																														the	square	root	of	4	is	2,
																														the	square	root	of	9	is	3,
																														the	square	root	of	16	is	4
                              and the square root of 25 is 5.2 Square Root

15The	symbol	   is	used	to	denote	the	square	root.	 Accordingly	we	can	write	
 etc.
It	is	clear	that	every	number	has	a	square.		However,	 does	every	positive	number	
have a square root? Let us investigate this.
According	 to	the	above	table,	the	square	root	of	4	is	2	and	the	square	root	of	9	
is	3.	The	square	root	of	a	number	between	4	and	9	is	a	value	between	2	and	3.	
Accordingly,	 it	is	clear	that	the	square	root	of	a	number	between	4	and	9	is	not	an	
integer.		It	is	a	decimal	number.		In	this	lesson	we	will	consider	how	an	approximate	
value	is	found	for	this.		 We	call	such	a	value	an	 approximation .
Let	us	for	example	consider	how	an	approximate	 value	is	obtained	for	the	square	
root of 5.
Consider	the	following	table.
Number How the square 
of the number is 
foundHow the square 
of the number is 
writtenThe square of the 
number
2 2 × 2 22 4
2.1 2.1 × 2.1 2.124.41
2.2 2.2 × 2.2 2.224.84
2.3 2.3	× 2.3 2.325.29
2.4 2.4 × 2.4 2.425.76
2.5 2.5 × 2.5 2.526.25
2.6 2.6	× 2.6 2.626.76
2.7 2.7 × 2.7 2.727.29
From	the	values	in	the	right	hand	side	column,	the	two	values	that	are	closest	to	5	
are	4.84	and	5.29.	They	are	the	squares	of	2.2	and	2.3	respectively.	 According	 to	the	
above	table,	the	square	roots	of	4.84	and	5.29	are	respectively	 2.2	and	2.3.	This	can	
be	written	symbolically	as	 and '
Now	let	us	examine	which	value	from	4.84	and	5.29	is	closer	to	5.
The	difference	between	4.84	and	5	=	5	–	4.84	=	0.16
The	difference	between	5.29	and	5	=	5.29	–	5	=	0.29
Accordingly,	 the	value	that	is	closer	to	5	is	4.84.	Therefore,	 2.2	can	be	taken	as	an	
approximate	 value	for	the	square	root	of	5.	The	value	that	is	obtained	for	the	square	
root	of	a	positive	integer	which	is	correct	to	the	first	decimal	place	is	called	the	

16“approximation to the first decimal place ” of the square root of the given number 
(or	more	simply	the	“ first approximation ”)
Accordingly,	 the	approximation	 of	square	root	of	5	to	the	first	decimal	place	is	2.2.	 	
When	an	approximate	 value	is	given,	the	symbol   is	used.		Accordingly,	 we	can	
write '
By	providing	 reasons	in	a	similar	manner,	we	can	conclude	 that	the	approximation	
of	square	root	of	6	to	the	first	decimal	place	is	2.4	and	the	approximation	 of	square	
root	of	7	to	the	first	decimal	place	is	2.6
That	is,
         
By	considering	 the	following	 examples	 let	us	now	learn	a	specific	method	of	finding	
the	first	approximation	 of	the	square	root	of	a	positive	number	which	is	not	a	perfect	
square.
Example 1
Approximate  to	the	first	decimal	place.
•		From	the	perfect	square	numbers	which	are	less	than	17,	the	one	which	is	closest	
to	it	is	16,	and	from	the	perfect	square	numbers	which	are	greater	than	17,	the	one	
which	is	closest	to	it	is	25.
	 Accordingly,	let	us	write	
	 	 	 16	<	17	<	25
•	When	we	write	the	square	root	of	each	of	these	numbers	we	obtain.
                
Accordingly,	 the	square	root	of	17	is	greater	than	4	which	is	the	square	root	of	16,	
and	less	than	5	which	is	the	square	root	of	25.
 i.e.,	 lies	between	4	and	5.
•	To	find	an	approximate	 value	close	to		,	let	us	check	whether	17	is	closer	to	
16	or	to	25.
 The	difference	between	16	and	17	is	1.		
 The difference between 17 and 25 is 8.

17	17	is	closer	to	16	than	to	25.
is	a	value	close	to	4.
i.e.,	one	of	the	values	4.1,	4.2,	4.3	and	4.4	can	be	the	first	approximation	of	  
•	Let	us	now	multiply	each	of	these	numbers	by	itself	to	identify	the	number	which	
has	a	product	which	is	closest	to	17.
When	the	first	two	values	are	squared	we	obtain

Since	the	value	of	4.22	exceeds	17,	it	is	unnecessary	to 	find	4.32 and 4.42.
16.81	is	the	closer	value	to	17	from	these	two.
 First approximation of   is 4.1

Since	245	is	closer	to	256	than	to	225,	 is	closer	to	16	than	to	15.	
		The	first	approximation	 of		can	be	one	of	15.5,	15.6,	15.7,	15.8	and	15.9.	
Let	us	now	determine	this	value.
 15'9 x 15'9 = 252'81 
 15'8 x 15'8 = 249'64
 15'7 x 15'7 = 246'49
 15'6 x 15'6 = 243'36
 From	the	above	values,	246.49	is	closest	to	245.
  First approximation of  is 15'7'
Exercise 2.1
Find	the	first	approximation	of	each	of	the	following	numbers.
   

182.2 The Division Method
Let	us	now	consider	a	method	of	finding	the	square	root	of	any	positive	number.	
This	method	is	called	the	division	method.	Let	us	study	this	method	by	considering	
several	examples.
Example 1  Find	the	square	root	of	1764.
Step 1
Separate	 1764	as	shown	below,	by	grouping	 the	digits	of	1764	in	pairs,	starting	
from	the	units	position	and	proceeding	towards	the	left.
17			64
Step 2 
Find	the	perfect	square	number	which	is	closest	to	the	leftmost	digit	or	pair	of	digits	
of	the	separated	 number,	and	as	indicated	 below,	write	its	square	root	above	and	to	
the	left	of	the	drawn	lines.
      
Step 3   
Write	down	the	product	4	x	4	of	the	number	above	and	to	the	left	of	the	lines,	below	
the	number	17	as	indicated,	and	subtract	it	from	17.
 
Step 4
Now	carry	down	the	next	two	digits	64,	as	indicated	below.
 
Step 5
Next,	write	on	the	left	as	shown	below,	the	digit	8,	which	is	two	times	the	number	
above	the	line,	leaving	space	for	another	number	to	be	written.	(i.e.,	leave	space	for	

19the digit in the units position)
 
Step 6
The	same	digit	should	be	written	above	the	line	to	the	right	of	4	and	in	the	space	left	
in	the	units	position	on	the	left.		This	digit	should	be	selected	so	that	the	product	of	
this	digit	and	the	number	obtained	on	the	left	when	this	digit	is	written	in	the	units	
position	(in	this	case	82),	is	equal	to	164,	or	is	the	closest	number	less	than	164	that	
can be obtained in this manner.
 Then  
When	finding	the	square	root	of	a	decimal	number,	separate	the	digits	in	pairs	on	
both	sides	of	the	decimal	point,	starting	at	the	decimal	point	as	shown	below.

We	must	find	the	value	to	three	decimal	places	and	round	off	to	two	decimal	places.
To	find	to	three	decimal	places	we	must	write	three	pairs	of	zeros	after	the	decimal	
point.

The figure depicts a slab of a certain type of chocolate.  
It has been divided into ten equal sized pieces such 
that the pieces can easily be broken off.
When the whole slab of chocolate is considered as one unit, 
● one piece of chocolate that is broken off is considered as  of the slab,
● two pieces of chocolate that are broken off is considered as  of the slab,
● three pieces of chocolate that are broken off is considered as of the slab.  
" " etc., which are used to represent portions of a whole unit, are examples 
of fractions.
Now let us consider another example. 
           
 
The above figure depicts how pieces of cheese have been arranged in a container. 
There are 8 equal pieces. One of the pieces has been removed from the container. 
This piece is  of the amount of cheese in the container. If the total mass of all the 
pieces of cheese in the container is 160 g, then the piece that was removed which is
of the total quantity of cheese in the container, is of mass 20 g. Fractions 3
PB 23

 The unit that has been considered here is the total mass of the cheese in the container 
which is 160 g.
When talking about fractions, it is important to be aware of the unit from which the 
factions are obtained.
For example, in the statement “ of all the students in the class are girls”, the 
fraction   is applied by taking “the total number of students in the class” as the 
unit.
In the following table, the units relevant to several statements involving fractions 
are given.
 
Situation Total Unit
 (a)   of the volume of the atmosphere consists of
       oxygen.
(b)  of the 50 litres of water has been used up.
(c)  of a 200 m2 plot of land has been used to                        
cultivate vegetables.
(d)  of the harvest was kept for consumption.
 (e)  of a piece of wire of length 5 m was cut.
(f) of the fruits in a collection of 25 oranges were 
ripe.
(g) A father wrote half (1

The circular shape illustrated in the following figure has been divided into 6 equal 
parts. We know that the fraction that has been shaded is of the shape.   
                                                               
    
24 25

The denominator of  is 6 and the numerator is 2. The total number of parts into 
which the unit has been divided is the denominator, and the number of parts being 
considered is the numerator.  Here, the numerator is smaller than the denominator.  
Such fractions are called proper fractions . Fractions such as  with 
numerator equal to 1 are called unit fractions .
In the following figures, quantities equal to  and  of the same unit have been 
shaded. Here the area of the rectangle has been taken as the unit.
It is clear from the above figures that  .
Further, considering fractions such as  , where the numerators are equal 
and th e denominators are not, as the denominator increases, the value represented 
by the fraction decreases.  That is,  
The following figure illustrates the three fractions  obtained from the 
same unit.
    
  
  
According to the figure, the quantities represented by the three fractions are equal.
That is,  .
Such fractions which are equal to each other are called equivalent fractions .  
Observe that fractions which are equivalent to a given fraction are obtained when 
24 25

both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the same number. 
For example,
         
Equivalent fractions are also obtained when the numerator and the denominator of 
the given fraction are divided by the same number.
For example,
        66 6 6
Now let us consider the two fractions   obtained from the same unit, which 
are unequal to each other. 
First let us write down several fractions which are equivalent to each of the fractions  
 and  '
        
It can be observed that among the fractions which are equivalent to  and , 
there are some which have the same denominator.   are two such fractions.   
 are two more such fractions.
For convenience, let us select which have the smallest common 
denominator.
Comparing  we obtain  '
However, since  8 and 9, we can conclude that '
Let us explain the comparison of   and  done above with equivalent fractions, 
using figures.
26 27

  It is clear from the figure too that  '
Accordingly, it is clear that it is suitable to write equivalent fractions having a 
common denominator when comparing fractions.
Now let us consider the addition and subtraction of fractions. 
You have learnt in earlier grades to add fractions with equal denominators, as for 
example      
  ' 
Similarly, you know that fractions with equal denominators can be subtracted as 
for example,          
  '
When adding and subtracting fractions of unequal denominators, the relevant 
fractions can first be converted into equivalent fractions of equal denominators.
For example,          
          
Fractions can also be used to represent quantities which are greater than a unit.
For example, let us see what quantity   of a loaf of bread is.  This is the amount 
that is obtained when a loaf of bread is divided into two equal parts and three such 
parts are considered. This quantity is one and a half loaves of bread.  That is,    
loaves of bread, which in short, is a quantity of '
As another example, let us illustrate  of a circle by a figure.    
   
      
If these three figures are considered together as one unit instead of separately, then 
the shaded region represents of the unit. However, if any one of these circles 
26 27

is taken as the unit, then the shaded region represents  of the unit. It is clear                  
therefore that the mixed number   can also be written as the fraction  .  
Another way in which the equality  = can be obtained is given below.
Accordingly, it is clear that  . When this amount is denoted by  , it is 
called a mixed number . When it is written as  , it is called an improper fraction . 
You have learnt in previous grades how a mixed number is converted into an 
improper fraction and how an improper fraction is converted into a mixed number.
Now let us recall what has been learnt about multiplying fractions. To do this, let us 
draw figures in the following manner to find out how much  of  is.   
             
 of 
According to the figure, it is clear that  of   is equal to   
The above answer can be obtained by simplifying this in the following manner too.      
 of 
It is clear that ‘of’ in  of denotes the mathematical operation multiplication 
and that the numerator can be taken as 1  « 3 and the denominator as  2  « 4'
28 29

Now let us consider the situation of dividing fractions.
Let us find how many   there are in . This is denoted by . It is clear from 
the following figure that this value is 2.
  
 
  
As another example, let us obtain half of ' 
 
 
 
3
5  
 
According to the figure, half of   is equal to '
However, since half of any quantity, is the amount that is obtained when the quantity 
is divided by 2,
 
It is not convenient to draw figures every time we divide fractions. We need to 
identify a different method to do this. The above division of fractions which was 
done using figures, can also be presented in the following manner . 
    
^Since 2 = &
(Multiplying by  which is the same as dividing by 2)
28 29

That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained using this 
method too.
Let us see whether this method works for '
         
 
That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained here.
When the numerator and the denominator of the fraction   are interchanged we 
obtain  ' We say that the reciprocal of   is ; that is 6. 
 
The reciprocal of a general term   is '
In general, when a fraction needs to be divided by another fraction, the first fraction 
can be multiplied by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
Let us recall all the facts that have been learnt so far regarding fractions by working 
out the following example.

3.1 Applications of fractions
Fractions are used in many calculations that come up in day to day life. These 
calculations can easily be carried out with a correct understanding of fractions. 
Given below are several examples of such situations.
Example 1 
 of a mixture of flour prepared to make a certain type of food consists of kurakkan 
flour, while the remaining portion consists of wheat flour. A cook wishes to prepare 
50 kg of this mixture to make the food item, to cater to an order. Find the amount 
of kurakkan flour and wheat flour required for this mixture.   
         Fraction of kurakkan flour in the mixture         
                  
 
 The quantity of kurakkan flour in the mixture  = 2 of 50 kg
                     = 50 kg 2  
      Quantity of kurakkan flour in the mixture   = 20 kg   
     The quantity of wheat flour in the mixture   = 50 – 20 kg
            = 30 kg
Example 2  
It takes 12 minutes to fill  of a certain tank using a pipe through which water flows 
at a uniform rate. Find the time it takes to fill the whole tank with water using this 
pipe.
              Time taken to fill   of the tank                  = 12 minutes         
 Time taken to fill    of the tank (that is, the whole tank)  = 12 × 4 minutes
      
                  = 48 minutes

4.2 Squares of binomial expressions
Let us turn our attention again to the following expressions which you expanded in 
the above exercise. 
Do you notice that the two binomial expressions to be multiplied are equal?
  (x + 2) ( x + 2) , (x – 3) (x – 3), (5 x – 2y) (5 x – 2y)
In the same manner that we write x × x = x2, we can write  ( x + 2)( x + 2) = ( x + 2)2.
Similarly,
             (x – 3) ( x – 3) = (x – 3)2
  (5x – 2y) (5x – 2y) = (5 x – 2y)2 
Each of these expressions written in the form ( x + 2)2, (x – 3)2 and (5 x – 2y)2 is 
called the square of the respective binomial expression.
The same method that was used above to simplify the product of two binomial 
expressions can be used to expand such squares of binomial expressions too.
 
Example 1  
Write ( x + 2)2 as a product of two binomial expressions and expand it.  
   
Simplifying the square of a binomial expression can be done using another method 
too.
Now let us consider how the squares of binomial expressions of the form  ( a + b ) 
and ( a – b ) are expanded.
     
42 43

 It is important to remember this as a formula.                       
 
 (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
Square of the first  term
Two times the product of the first 
and second termsSquare of the second term
Now let us consider the expansion of ( a − b)2 
       
That is,   (a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2
Note : The expansion of ( a − b)2 can also be obtained by substituting − b for b in 
the expansion of ( a + b)2
i.e.,   ( a + (− b))2 = a2 + 2( a) (− b) + (− b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2
Also,   
 
You may have observed that the expansions of ( a + b)2 and (– a – b)2 are equal to 
each other and that the expansions of ( a – b)2 and (– a + b)2 too are equal to each 
other. 
Now study how the following squares of binomial expressions have been expanded.

 Congruence of two plane figures
If we examine the above figures we see that they are all closed plane figures 
consisting of straight line segments. Such figures are called rectilinear plane figures. 
The sides and the angles are called the elements (parts) of these figures.
The pairs of rectilinear plane figures presented below in figures (i) to (iv), which 
are identical in shape and size can be placed on each other such that they coincide.
(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)
A pair of plane figures which may be made to coincide is called a pair of congruent 
plane figures . In this section we concentrate on the congruence of pairs of triangles.
 5'1 Congruence of two triangles
A triangle has six elements. They are the three sides and the three angles of the 
triangle.
Let us assume that the two triangles  ABC and PQR given below are congruent. 
Let us also assume  that, when the two triangles are placed one on top of the other  Congruence of Triangles 5
48 49

such that they coincide,  then AB coincides with PQ, AC  coincides with  PR and BC 
coincides with QR. Then we say that, in the two triangles, the side corresponding 
to AB is PQ,  the side corresponding to  AC is PR and the side corresponding to  BC 
is QR. Similarly, we say that the angle corresponding to   is , the angle 
corresponding to   is  and the angle corresponding to  is .                  
   A
BCP Q
R
 
Accordingly, in congruent triangles, the corresponding elements are equal to each 
other.
We indicate the fact that two triangles are congruent by using the symbol  zzZZ' For 
example, if the two triangles ABC  and PQR  are congruent, we indicate this fact by  
writing /unif0ba /unif044/unif044  
It is not necessary to show that the six elements of one triangle are equal to the six 
elements of the other triangle as indicated above to show that a pair of triangles is 
congruent. It is sufficient to show that three of the elements are equal. However, 
this does not mean that if any three elements of one triangle are equal to three 
elements of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. In certain cases, 
when three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle, 
then the remaining elements too are equal and the triangles are congruent. There are 
four such cases. Let us now consider these four cases.
(a) First Case
The case in which two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two 
sides and the included angle of another triangle
Activity
Three triangles with two sides of length 2'5 cm and 3'5 cm and an angle of magnitude 
30o are given below.

  ² Copy the triangle ABC  onto a tissue paper and cut it out.
² Examine whether the cut out triangle can be made to coincide with the triangles 
PQR  and LMN .
  ² Accordingly, select the triangle which is congruent to the triangle ABC .
48 49

It must be clear to you through the above activity, that only the triangle PQR  is 
congruent to the triangle ABC . Both the triangles PQR  and LMN  have three elements 
which are equal to the given three elements of the triangle ABC . However, the 
triangle ABC  is only congruent to the triangle PQR . It should be clear to you from 
this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each 
other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent.
Let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC  is 
congruent to the triangle PQR  but not to the triangle LMN . The 30o angle of the 
triangle ABC  is the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm. It is the 
same for the triangle PQR . However the 30o angle is not the included angle of the 
sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm of the triangle LMN . Two sides and the included 
angle of triangle ABC  are equal to two sides and the included angle of triangle PQR . 
But this cannot be said about the triangles ABC and LMN .  There is insufficient 
data to state that and ABC and   LMN ∆ ∆  are congruent.
Note:  Here the angle ACB
> which is 30o is called the included angle of the sides 
AC and CB. Similarly, the angle RPQ
> is the included angle of the sides PR and PQ 
of the triangle PQR .
This result which you discovered through the above activity has been used as an 
axiom of geometry from ancient times.
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the 
included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Showing that two triangles are congruent in the above manner is mentioned in short 
as being congruent under the case SAS. 
The two triangles ABC  and PQR  given below can be shown to be congruent 
according to the above mentioned case using the given data as follows.

Since the above two triangles are congruent, the remaining corresponding elements 
are also equal.
50 51

That is,
the sides AB and QR which are opposite the equal angles ACB

to each other, the angles ABC  > and QRP
> which are opposite the equal sides AC and 
PQ are equal to each other,
and the angles CAB  > and PQR  > which are opposite the equal sides BC and PR are 
equal to each other. 
Now let us consider an example.
Example 1                                     
According to the data marked on the figure, prove that the triangles ABC  and ADC  
are congruent, and write all the remaining equal corresponding elements.

be identified.

² Copy the triangle ABC  onto a tissue paper and cut it out.
² Place it on the triangles PQR  and LMN  and examine which triangle it coincides 
with.
² Accordingly, which triangle is congruent to the triangle ABC ?
It must be clear to you according to this activity that the trianlge ABC is congruent 
only to the triangle  PQR .
In this case too, as in the case ( a), the two triangles  PQR  and LMN  have three 
elements which are equal to three elements of the triangle ABC . However, although 
the triangle ABC  is congruent to the triangle PQR , it is not congruent to the triangle 
LMN . As before, it should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles 
have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles 
are congruent. 52 53

Therefore, let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle   
ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR . The given side of length 2.5 cm is opposite 
the given 30o angle of the triangle ABC . It is the same for the triangle PQR . However 
it is not the same in the triangle LMN . Accordingly, two angles of triangle ABC  is 
equal to two angles of triangle PQR , and one side of triangle ABC  is equal to the 
corresponding  side of triangle PQR . However, the corresponding side of triangle  
LMN is not equal to that of triangle ABC .
Note: Here, corresponding sides are defined as those which are opposite equal 
angles of the two triangles.
If two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding 
side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated 
concisely as being congruent according to the AAS  case.
Using the given data, we can show as done below, that the triangles STU and LMN 
in the following figure are congruent according to the case mentioned above.

Two angles of the triangle  ABC are equal to two angles of the triangle  PQR.  Also,

angles ACB

The case of three sides of a triangle being equal to three sides of another triangle
Can a unique triangle be constructed when the lengths of the three sides of the 
triangle are given?  To determine this, engage in the following activity.
Activity
Break off pairs of ekel sticks of lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm respectively. Make 
two triangles of side lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm with these pieces. Do you see 
that the two triangles have to be congruent? By changing the positions of the pieces 
of ekel in one triangle, can you create a triangle which is not congruent to the other 
triangle?  It must be clear to you that this is not possible.
This result which you established through the above activity can also be used as an 
axiom.
If the three sides of a triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then 
the two triangles are congruent. 
Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely

    • find the factors of the difference of two squares.
Factors of algebraic expressions
We know that 2 x + 6 is a binomial algebraic expression.  Since it can be expressed 
as 2( x + 3), we also know that 2 and x + 3 are its factors.
Similarly, since 4 x2 + 6x = 2x (2x + 3), we know that 2, x and 2 x + 3 are the factors 
of 4x2 + 6x. 
Now let us find the factors of a2 – 2a + ab – 2b 
    a2 – 2a + ab – 2b = a (a – 2) + b (a – 2)
    = (a – 2)(a + b )
Therefore, the factors of  a2 − 2a + ab − 2b are a − 2 and a + b.  
Do the following exercise to further recall what has been learnt earlier about 
factoring algebraic expressions.

Defining trinomial quadratic expressions
Now let us consider factoring quadratic expressions such as x2 + 2x – 3. This 
expression is of the form  ax2 + bx + c.  Here a, b and c take integer values. 
We call an algebraic expression of the form  ax2 + bx + c , where a, b and c are 
non-zero, a trinomial quadratic expression in x. a is said to be the coefficient of 
x2, b the coefficient of x and c the constant term. It is easy to find the factors of 
such an expression when the terms are written in this order. The coefficient of 
x2 in   x2  + 2x – 3 is 1 while the coefficient of x is 2 and the constant term is – 3 .                                                                                                                                           
4 + 2x – x2 is also a trinomial quadratic expression. To find its factors it can be 
written in the order  – x2 + 2x + 4.
When the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 2xy –  y2 is  considered, it can be 
thought of as a quadratic expression in x or a quadratic expression in y. When it is 
considered as a quadratic expression in y, it is convenient to write it in the form             
– y2 + 2xy + x2. 
For example, while  3x2 − 2x − 5, a2 + 2a + 8, y2 + 2y − 5 and 5 −2x − 3x2  are 
trinomial quadratic expressions, the expressions  a + 2x + 3 and  2 x3 + 3x2 −5x are 
not.
7.1  Factors of trinomial quadratic expressions
Let us recall how the product of two binomial expressions such as x + 2 and x + 3 
is found.
 
Since x2 + 5x + 6 is obtained as the product of x + 2 and x +  3 ,  w e  o b t a i n  t h a t                         
x + 2 and x + 3 are factors of x2 + 5x + 6.  x2 + 5x + 6 is a trinomial qudratic 
74 75

expression. How do we obtain x + 2 and x + 3 as its factors?  Let us examine the 
steps that were performed to obtain the product of the above two expressions, in 
the reverse order.
² The middle term 5 x of the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 5x + 6, has 
been expressed as a sum of two terms, as  3 x + 2x   
² The product of the terms 3 x and 2x = 3x « 2x = 6x2
² The product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial quadratic 
expression  x2 + 5x + 6 is x2 « 6 = 6 x2
We can come to the following conclusions based on the above observations.
The middle term should be written as the sum of two terms.  The product of these 
two terms should be equal to the product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial 
expression.
As an example, let us factor  x2  + 7x + 10 accordingly. Here, 7 x is the middle term. 
This should be written as the sum of two terms. Also, the product of these two terms 
should be equal to 10 x2.  
The product of the initial and final terms =  x2 × 10 = 10 x2
     The middle term = 7 x
Let us find the pair of terms which has 10 x2 as its product and 7 x as its sum. Let us 
consider the following table to do this. The two terms in the first column have been 
selected such that their product is 10 x2.
 Pair of  terms Product Sum
   x, 10x 
   2x, 5x   
 (−x),  (− 10x) 
(−2x) , (− 5x)      x x 10x = 10x2
   2x x  5x  = 10x2 
 (−x) x(− 10x) = 10x2
(−2x) x(− 5x)  = 10x2     x +10x   = 11 x
   2x +  5x   = 7 x
 (−x )+ (−10x) = −11x
(−2x) + (−5x ) = −7x
 
It is clear from the above table that the middle term 7 x should be written as 2 x + 5x. 
Now, let us find the factors of the given trinomial quadratic expression.
        
Therefore, the factors of x2 + 7x + 10 are x + 2 and x + 5. 
Let us see whether the factors are different if we write the middle term of                                   
x2 + 7x + 10 as the sum 5 x + 2x, instead of 2 x + 5x.
  x2 + 7x + 10  =  x2 + 5x + 2x + 10 
    = x (x+ 5) + 2(x+ 5)
    = (x+ 5) (x+ 2)
76 77

We observe that the same factors are obtained. Therefore, the order in which we 
write the two terms that were selected has no effect on the factors. Accordingly, the 
factors can be found by writing 7 x as either 2 x + 5x or as  5 x + 2x.
Example 1
Factor   a2 −8a + 12. 
 The product of the initial and final terms  = a2  «12 = 12 a2
                           The middle term   = − 8a
Find the two terms which have 12 a2 as their product and −8a as their sum.
The following table contains pairs of terms of  which the product is 12 a2. The pair 
which when added equals – 8a has been shaded.
        
Pair of  terms Product Sum
               a + 12a = 13 a
           2 a + 6a   = 8a
           3 a + 4a   = 7a
  (−a) + (−12a) = −13a
  (−2a ) + ( −6a) = −8a
  (−3a) + (−4a) = −7a(

That is, − 8a can be written as  −2a − 6a
 a2  −8a + 12    = a2 −2a − 6a +12
   = a (a −2) − 6 (a −2)
   =  ( a −2) (a −6)
                                       Note(-------- A table has been used here only as an illustration. The middle term can be 
obtained as a sum mentally too.
Example 2
Factor  x2 − 7x − 8. 
The product of the initial and final terms  = x2 × (−8)  = − 8x2
                    The middle term = − 7x
The two terms which have −8x2  as their product and −7x as their sum are + x and
− 8x.                                
Accordingly,  
Now let us consider how an expression such as − x2 − x + 6 which has a negative 
quadratic term is factored.  The factors can be found by re-writing the expression 
76 77

as 6 − x − x2, with the quadratic term at the end. By considering the example given 
below, let us recognize the fact that the factors can be found using either form.
Example 3
Factor − x2 − x + 6.  
The product of the initial and final terms =  − 6x2
The middle term = − x
''' − x should be written as 2x − 3x.
  or
Example 4  
Factor a2 − 4ab − 5b2. 
We may consider this as a trinomial quadratic expression in a.
Then, 
the product of the initial and final terms = a2 « (−5b2) = −5a2b2
             The middle term = −4ab
The two terms which have −5a2b2 as their product and −4ab as their sum are ab 
and −5ab.
           
Note( This can also be considered as a trinomial quadratic expression in b and 
factored. Then too the above answer is obtained.
  Accuracy of the factors of a trinomial quadratic expression
The errors made in simplification can be minimized by examing the accuracy of the 
factors of a trinomial quadratic expression once they have been found.   For example , 
let us factor x2 + 3x – 40.
  x2 + 3x – 40 = x2 + 8x – 5x – 40
  = x (x + 8) – 5 (x + 8)
  =  ( x + 8) (x – 5)      
78 79

If the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct, by multiplying them together we should be 
able to get back our original expression.  Let us find the product of  x + 8 and x – 5 
(x + 8) (x – 5) = x2 – 5x + 8x – 40
        = x2 + 3x – 40
  
Since we have obtained our original expression  x2 + 3x – 40, the factors x + 8 and 
x – 5 are correct.

7.2 The factors of trinomial quadratic expressions described            
      further
So far we have considered only how the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions 
with the coefficient of  x2 equal to either 1  or –1 are found.  Now let us consider 
how the factors are found when the coefficient of x2 is some other integer. For 
example, let us consider the trinomial quadratic expression 3x2 + 14x + 15. This is 
of the form ax2 + bx + c  with a = 3. In such cases too we can use the same method 
that we used above. 
Example 1 
Factor 3 x2 + 14x + 15. 
The product of the initial and final terms   = 45x2
The middle term   14x   needs to be written as 5 x + 9x. (since  5x × 9x = 45x2).

7.3 The factors of expressions which are in the form of the    
     difference of two squares
Consider the product of the two binomial expressions ( x − y) and (x + y)   
  (x − y) (x + y) = x2 + xy − xy − y2
                                           = x2 − y2
We have obtained x2 − y2 which is a difference of two squares. We observe from 
the above expansion that the factors of x2 − y2  are x − y and x + y. Further, x2 − y2  
can be considered as a quadratic expression in x and factored. By taking its middle 
term to be 0, we can write it in the form of a trinomial quadratic expression as                        
x2 + 0 − y2.  Let us factor this expression.
  Product of the initial and final terms  = − x2y2 
                            Middle term = 0  
Accordingly, the pair of terms with product  − x2y2 and sum 0 is − xy and xy.
                 
Therefore, by this too we obtain  x2 – y2 = (x – y ) (x + y ). 
Let us consider the following examples of the factorization of expressions which 
are the difference of two squares.
Example 1  
Factor (i) x2 – 4  (ii) 4x2 – 9 (iii) 25a2 – 16b2

8.1 The interior and exterior angles of a triangle
The angles " and which are within the triangle ABC  are called the 
interior angles of the triangle ABC  (in short, these are called the angles of the 
triangle ABC ).
The side BC of the triangle ABC  has been 
produced up to D as indicated in the figure. The 
angle  which is then formed is an exterior 
angle  of the triangle. Since BCD  is a straight 
line, is an adjacent supplementary angle of 
' The angles and which are the 
interior angles of triangle ABC  apart from  
are called the interior opposite angles  of the 
exterior angle . In the same manner, there are pairs of interior opposite angles 
corresponding to the exterior angles formed by producing the other two sides of the 
triangle too.  
The following theorem specifies a relationship that exists between an exterior angle 
of a triangle and its interior opposite angles.
Theorem:  The exterior angle formed when a side of a triangle is produced   
is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.

By studying this lesson you will be able to
     solve problems by applying the theorem on isosceles triangles and its converse.
9.1 Isosceles triangles
If two sides of a triangle are equal, then it is called an isosceles triangle. The triangle 
ABC in the figure given below is an isosceles triangle. In this triangle, AB = AC. 
The angle in front of each side of a triangle is called the angle opposite that side.
C BA
The angle opposite the side AB is . 
The angle opposite the side AC is . 
The angle opposite the side  BC is .
Further, A, which is the vertex at which the two equal sides meet 
is called the apex of the triangle.
A theorem related to isosceles triangles is given below.
Theorem:  If two sides are equal in a triangle, the angles opposite the equal 
sides are equal.
According to the theorem, since AB = AC  in the above isosceles triangle ABC,  
' Let us engage in the following activity to verify the truth of the above 
theorem.  
Activity
² Mark three points A, B  and  C (not collinear) such that AB = AC = 5cm.
² Complete the triangle ABC  by joining the points A, B and C.
² Cut out the shape of the triangle ABC.

            =  (Angles opposite equal sides in triangle ABC ) 
    '''     = 40x

9.2 The formal proof of the theorem on isosceles triangles and     
      applications of the theorem
Let us formally prove the theorem “In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite 
equal sides are equal”.
   Data              :  AB = AC  in the triangle  ABC
  To prove that:  
Construction  : Draw the bisector AD of the interior angle  such that it                                                     
meets BC at D.
 Proof: In the triangles ABD  and ACD,
Now let us consider how several results on triangles are proved using the above 
theorem.
Example 1
AB = AC  in the triangle ABC  in the figure.                                  
Show that the following coincide.   
    (i) The perpendicular drawn from  A to BC.
   (ii) The bisector of the interior angle BAC<
. 
  (iii) The straight line joining  A and the midpoint of  BC. 
  (iv) The perpendicular bisector of BC. 
Let us first draw the perpendicular from the vertex A to the opposite side BC.

       Therefore  AD is the line joining A and the mid point of BC.
(construction). 
Therefore, AD is the perpendicular bisector of BC.
   In an isosceles triangle,
   1. the perpendicular drawn from the apex to the opposite side
   2. the bisector of the apex angle,
   3. the straight line joining the apex to the midpoint of the opposite side and
4. the perpendicular bisector of the side opposite the apex, 
    coincide with each other.
In some instances, a result in geometry can be proved in several ways.
Now, let us consider such a result.
Example 2
AB = AC in the triangle  ABC. The side  BA has been produced to  E. The angle   
is bisected by AD.  Prove that AD and BC are parallel to each other.
                           AE
D
C B
102 103

To prove that AD // BC , let us show that either a pair of alternate angles or a pair of 
corresponding angles are equal to each other. 
Proof:
Method 1
In the triangle  ABC,   (AB = AC , angles opposite equal sides)
Since the side  BA of the triangle ABC has been produced to  E, 
(Theorem on the exterior angle)
From the figure,Since
(Since AD is the bisector of EAC)1
2
∴
This is a pair of alternate angles. Since a pair of alternate angles are equal, AD is 
parallel to BC.
Method 2
According to the above figure, and EAD
>are a pair of corresponding angles. 
By showing that these two angles are equal in the same manner as above, we can 
show that BC // AD.
Method 3
The above proof could also be given as follows using algebraic symbols.
In the triangle ABC, let = x  (1)
                 =  (Since AB = AC )
      '''    = x 
Since the side  BA of the triangle ABC has been produced to  E, 
                            (Theorem on the exterior angle)
              = x + x
                         = 2x     
             (2)
   From (1) and (2), EAD = ABC

This is a pair of corresponding angles. Since a pair of corresponding angles are 
equal,   AD//BC.

11210.1  Inverse Proportions
We know that, when we consider two quantities, if when one quantity increases 
according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also increases in the same ratio, 
or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity 
also decreases in the same ratio, then the two quantities are said to be directly 
proportional  to each other. 
In an inverse proportion , when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio, 
the other quantity decreases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases 
according to a certain ratio, the other quantity increases in the same ratio.
Let us establish this fact further by considering the following example.
In a certain hostel, there is sufficient food stored for 12 hostellers for 4 days. 
Keeping this amount of food in mind, let us consider the following questions.
   (i) If the number of hostellers is 15, will the food be sufficient for four days?
  (ii) If the number of hostellers is 6, for how many days will the food be sufficient?
 (iii) When the number of hostellers decreases, does the number of days for which 
the food is sufficient decrease? Or does it increase?
(iv) For how many days will this food, which is sufficient for 12 hostellers for          
4 days, be sufficient for one person?
It is clear that the food which is sufficient for 12 people for 4 days will be sufficient 
for 6 people for 8 days, and for one person for 48 days. The following relationships 
between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is 
sufficient can easily be identified.
 
  Number of hostellers  Number of days                       
          12      4 
                  8                6                                                         
                   6    8
                    4    12
                              2    24
                    1    48  
                                                                
Let us see how the two quantities, namely the number of hostellers and the number 
of days for which the food is sufficient change proportionally. According to the 
above chart, when the number of hostellers decreases from 8 to 2, the number of 
days for which the food is sufficient increases from 6 to 24. 

113In this case, the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1
The number of days for which the food is sufficient in this case has increased from 
6 to 24.
  The ratio of the number of days = 6 : 24 = 1 : 4
Although the ratio 1 : 4 is not equal to the ratio 4 : 1, the ratio that is obtained by 
interchanging the two numbers of one ratio is the same as the other ratio.  
        
Then,
                                      the ratio of the number of hostellers  =  8 : 2    =  4 : 1
the ratio of the corresponding number of days  interchanged = 24 : 6  =  4 : 1
A relationship such as the above one between the number of hostellers and the 
number of days for which the food is sufficient is called an inverse proportion .
Let us consider two more instances of the relationship between the number of 
hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient.
              Number of hostellers   Number of days
   12         4
    1                    48
                                          Ratio of the number of hostellers = 12  :  1
    Ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 48  :  4  =  12  :  1
The inverse proportion relationship should hold for any two cases that are considered, 
in the same manner that was observed in the above cases.
Two more examples of inverse proportions are given below.
(i) The number of people required to complete a particular task and the amount of 
time taken to complete the task.
 (ii) When a vehicle travels a constant distance with uniform speed, the speed of the 
car and the time taken to complete the journey.
Now, let us consider the following example.
Example 1
It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. Find the number of days required 
by 10 men to complete the same task.
Let us look at two methods that can be used to solve this problem.
Note that this is a problem on inverse proportions.

114Method 1
Let us take the number of days required by 10 men to complete the task as x. Then,
   Number of men  Number of days
     5         8
   10                x   
Since this is an inverse proportion,
                          5 : 10   = x : 8 
                                    = 
                      10 x = 8 « 5
       = 40
                      x   = 
       = 4
     The number of days required by 10 men to complete the task = 4 
Method 2
      Time taken for 5 men to complete the task =  8 days
 Time taken for one man to complete the task =  8 days « 5
         = 40 days
         Time taken for 10 men to complete the task = 40 days  ÷ 10
                  = 4 days
Note: In the above example, the number of days taken by one man to complete the 
task, which is 40, can be taken as a measurement of the magnitude of the task. This 
value is called the number of man days .
 Magnitude of the task  = Amount of time required by one man to complete the task
    = Number of men  « Number of days
Accordingly, the magnitude of the above task can be considered as 40 man days.
The magnitude of a task can be measured in terms of man days as well as in terms 
of man hours.
Example 2
It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. How many men are required to 
complete the same task in 2 days?
Let us use method (ii) of example 1.
       The number of days required by 5 men to complete the task  = 8
 The number of days required by one man to complete the task  = 8 « 5
                                                            The magnitude of the task  = 8 « 5 man days
                       =  40 man days     
  The number of men required to complete the task in 2 days    =   40 ÷ 2      
                =   20    

115Example 3
Food sufficient for 12 days for a group of 40 men employed at a worksite has been 
stored at the site. If 8 more men join the workforce after 6 days, for how many more 
days will the food that is remaining be sufficient?
Let us now consider how this problem is solved by two different methods.
Method 1
   Amount of food sufficient for 40 men for 12 days    =  40 × 12
                  =  480
        Amount of food sufficient for 40 men for 6 days = 40 × 6
                   = 240
                 Amount of food remaining    = 480 – 240
                   =  240
              Number of days this food is sufficient for 48 men   =  240 ÷ 48
                                                        = 5 days
Let us now see how this sum can be solved algebraically.
Method 2
The food which is sufficient for the group of 40 men for 12 days will be sufficient 
for the 40 of them for 6 days and for a few more days for the 48 men, which 
includes the 8 who joined later. 
Let us take the number of days for which the food will be sufficient for the                              
48 men after the 6th day as x. We can then equate the amount of food sufficient for 
the 40 men for 12 days to the sum of the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men 
for 6 days and the 48 men for x days.
             40 « 12
       480
       48x
             x =  (40 « 6) + (48  « x)
          =  240 + 48 x
                      =  480 − 240
  =  240
   =  
  =  5
  Therefore, the remaining food will be sufficient for 5 days.

   (i) What is the magnitude of the task in man hours?
 (ii) The four men decide to complete the task on the next day. How many hours 
will they have to work to achieve this?   
        
 10.2 Representing inverse proportions algebraically 
If it takes eight men one day to complete a certain task, then
• four men would require two days to complete the same task
• if only two men are engaged, four days would be required to complete the task 
• it would take one man eight days to complete the task
Observe that in all four of the above situations, the product of the number of men 
and the number of days is a constant.  That is, 
  number of men ×  number of days = a constant
This constant value is the magnitude of the task. The unit used to measure the 
magnitude of the task can be taken as man days.
Accordingly, if x is the number of men and y is the number of days, then
     xy  =   k     (k is a constant)  
    '''   x  = k
y   or y = k
x
According to the definition of direct proportion, this can be expressed as  ' 
That is, x and    are directly proportional to each other. In this case we say that x 
and y are inversely proportional to each other.
Example 1
8 men can complete a certain task in 9 days.  However, it was possible to employ 
only 6 men. How many days will it take these 6 men to complete the task?
Let us denote the number of men by x and the number of days by y.  Then, by using 
the equation xy = k  and substituting the data, we obtain the equations,

118 8 « 9    k and
      6y    k 
Note that we can use the same constant k as we refer to the same task.
Since it is the same task, the constant k is the same.
Substituting for k, we obtain the equation
 i.e.,y
y
 Therefore, it will take these 6 men 12 days to complete the task.
Example 2
A group of men, who completed a certain task in 9 days, recruited 3 more men to 
work on a similar task. If together they completed the task in 6 days, find how many 
men there were in the initial group.
Suppose the number of men who were in the first group is x.
Then, according to the data, we obtain the equations,
Therefore, the number of men in the initial group was 6.
Solve the sums in the exercise given below algebraically.

The pie chart is another method of representing data. Pie charts are also called pie 
graphs. By studying this lesson you will be able to
 ² draw pie charts based on the given data

PB 119

In a pie chart, the area of the whole circle represents the total number of data. The 
different frequencies are represented by suitable sectors.  
Let us now consider how these sectors are found.
As an example, let us consider the above circle which has been divided into 8 equal 
sectors.
Since the circle has been divided into 8 equal sectors, the area of each sector is 
equal to  1 of the area of the circle.  
Also, the angle around the centre of this circle is divided into eight equal parts by 
the sectors.
Therefore, the angle at the centre of each sector is  1 of the angle around the centre.   
The angle around the center is 360x. Therefore the angle at the centre of each sector 
is 1 of 360x.
    That is, the angle at the centre of a sector which is 1 of the circle                  
Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which is 3 of the circle  
 
Now let us draw a suitable pie chart to represent the data in the above table.  
First, let us draw a circle of suitable radius (about 3 cm ') 
Let us represent the 60 students by the total area of the circle, which corresponds to 
the angle of 360o around the centre of the circle.
120 121

 Then the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes one student. 
Accordingly, the angle at the centre of the sector which 
denotes the 25 students who like cricket the most
Now let us represent this within the circle as followsSector denoting one student.
The sector which denotes the 
students who like cricket the most6x
Cricket
150x
Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which 
denotes the 20 students who like volleyball the most  
    
The remaining sector of the circle represents the students who like elle. The 
correspo nding angle at the centre can be found using  ' However this is not 
necessary, since this angle is equal to the angle obtained by subtracting the above 
two angles from 360o' All the above facts can be shown in a pie chart as follows.

Usually the angle at the centre is not denoted in a pie chart. Instead, the value 
represented by each sector is given as a percentage.šš
120 121

The comparison of data is facilitated by the sectors being shaded in different colours 
or covered with different patterns ' Since all the data is represented by one circle 
comparisons such as ‘more than’ or ‘less than’ can easily be made.
Example 1
The information on the type of lunch packet preferred by 600 people who participated 
in a ‘Shramadana’ is given below.

 Let us represent the above information in a pie chart. 
 The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the     
    250 people who prefer fish    
 The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the      
            150 people who prefer eggs      
           
 The angle at the centre of the sector denoting the     
          75 people who prefer chicken  
            
It is not neccessary to calculate the angle at the centre of the sector denoting those 
who prefer vegetables since the remaining portion of the circle denotes this.
The pie chart prepared according to the above information is given below.

129By studying this lesson you will be able to 
 find the least common multiple of several algebraic expressions.
Finding the least common multiple of numbers
The least common multiple (LCM) of several whole numbers is the smallest number 
which is divisible by all these numbers. You have learnt earlier how this is found.  
Let us recall what you have learnt.
Let us find the least common multiple of the numbers 6, 8 and 12 by writing these 
numbers as a product of their prime factors.
     
The distinct prime factors of the above three numbers are 2 and 3.  When all three 
numbers are considered,
    the greatest power of 2 = 23
    the greatest power of 3  = 31
  ∴ The least common multiple  
Accordingly, the least common multiple of several numbers can be found in the 
following manner.
 1. Write each number as a product of its prime factors.
2. From the factors of all the numbers, select the greatest power of each prime 
number.
 3. By multiplying all these powers together, obtain the required LCM.

certain day, after how many days will they all arrive at this housing scheme again 
on the same day? 
3. Mr. Gunatillake visits Galle Face grounds every Sunday evening to observe the 
setting of the sun.  Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Perera too visit the same location once 
every 6 days and once every 8 days respectively for the same reason. If the three 
of them met each other for the first time in Galle Face grounds on Sunday the 8th 
of December 2013, after how many days did they all meet each other again at the 
same location? On which date did they meet again?
4. When a number is divided by each of the numbers 5, 6 and 7, a remainder of 1 is 
obtained.  Find the smallest such number.
 12.1    Finding the least common multiple of algebraic terms
Now let us consider what is meant by the least common multiple of several algebraic
terms and how it is found. 
Let us find the least common multiple of 4 a2, 6ab  and  8 b.
Let us write each term as a product of its factors.
 
The distinct factors of these algebraic terms are 2, 3, a and b.
 The largest power of 2 is 23
 The largest power of 3 is 31
 The largest power of a is a2
 The largest power of b is b1
 
 ∴ LCM b
b
The least common multiple is obtained by taking the product of the largest 
powers of all the distinct factors of the given algebraic terms.

12.2 Finding the least common multiple of algebraic expressions which 
include binomial expressions
Let us find the least common multiple of  2 x + 4  and  3x – 9.
To find the LCM of such expressions, their factors need to be found first.  
 2x + 4 =  2 ^x + 2& 
 3x – 9 =  3 ^x – 3&
The distinct factors are 2, 3, ^x + 2& and ^x – 3&. The index of each of these factors 
is 1. 
The product of the largest powers of these factors   
                                     ∴  LCM 
Example 1 
Find the least common multiple of  15x2" 20 ^x + 1&" 10 ^x + 1&2
          15 x2  = 3 « 5 « x2
 20 ^x + 1& = 2 « 2 « 5 « ^x +1& = 22 « 5 « ^x + 1&
10 ^x + 1&2 = 2 « 5 « ^x +1&2
The distinct factors are 2, 3, 5, x and ( x + 1).
∴ LCM  
Example 2
Find the least common multiple of the algebraic expressions ( b – a), 2(a – b) and 
4a2 (a – b)2 
        Since ( a – b ) is a factor of two of 
these expressions, it is necessary to 
express ( b – a ) as – (a – b ).

132The distinct factors are 2, ( –1), a and ( a – b ).
∴ The product of the largest powers  
                                             ∴ LCM 
                                
Note:  Knowing that although  a – b = – (b – a ), we have ( a – b )2 = (b – a )2 , facilitates
problem solving.

12.3 Finding the least common multiple of algebraic expressions,
        described further
(a) When there is a difference of two squares
Example 1
Find the least common multiple of the algebraic expressions  2x – 6" 4x ^x – 3&2 and 
6 ^x2 – 9& 
2x – 6     = 2 ^x – 3&
4x ^x – 3&2 = 2 « 2 « x « ^x – 3&2
6 ^x2 – 9&  = 2 « 3 «  ^x – 3& ^x + 3&
The distinct factors are  2" 3" x" ^x – 3& and ^x + 3&
                     ∴  LCM = 22 « 3 «  x « ^x + 3& « ^x – 3&2
   = 12x ^x + 3& ^x – 3&2
                    
(b) When there are trinomial quadratic expressions
Example 2
Find the least common multiple of the algebraic expressions 3 ^x + 2&2" x2 + 5x + 6" 
and 2x2 + 7x + 3 
    3 ^ x + 2&2 = 3 « ^ x + 2&2
   x2 + 5x + 6 = ^x + 2& ^x + 3&
 2 x2 + 7x + 3 = ^x + 3& ^2x + 1&
The distinct factors are   3" ^ x + 2&" ^x + 3& and ^2x + 1& 
                ∴  LCM = 3 ^x + 3& ^2x + 1& ^x + 2&2

134By studying this lesson you will be able to 
 simplify algebraic fractions with unequal denominators.
Algebraic Fractions
Given below are several examples of algebraic fractions.
    
There are algebraic expressions in the numerator, the denominator or both the 
numerator and the denominator of each of these algebraic fractions.
Do the following exercise by applying what you have learnt earlier about adding 
and subtracting algebraic fractions.
Review Exercise 
Simplify the following algebraic fractions.
13.1 Simplifying fractions with unequal algebraic terms in the denominator
Simplify
 
x and 2 x are the two terms in the denominators of   and  respectively. Since 
they are unequal, the two fractions cannot be added directly.  Therefore, let us 
first write equivalent fractions that have a common denominator and then do the 
simplification.
That is,  
                               
Here 2 x is the denominator of the equivalent fractions. Observe that 2 x is the leastAlgebraic Fractions 13

As was done in 13.1 above, here too the LCM of the algebraic expressions in 
the denominators is first found and the simplification is done after the equivalent 
fractions with a common denominator are found.

139 14.1 Taxes
The government of each country collects money from its citizens to meet recurrent 
expenses.  This money is called taxes. Different types of taxes are collected in 
different ways and in varying amounts. The method that is used most to collect 
taxes is charging a percentage of the amount involved. Taxes that an individual has 
to pay directly to the government are called direct taxes.  Several types of direct 
taxes are given below.
 • Rates
 • Customs duty
 • Income tax
Taxes that are not charged directly are called indirect taxes. Value added tax (V AT) 
is one such tax that is charged at present.
Rates
Rates are taxes charged by urban councils, municipal councils, provincial councils 
etc., from households and businesses that come within their administrative domain. 
These taxes are used for various purposes such as the maintenance of roads and 
street lights, garbage collection and disposal etc.  Properties owned by individuals 
and businesses are assessed annually by the government, and the relevant council 
charges a percentage of the assessed annual value of the property as rates. This 
is calculated annually and can be paid in total at the beginning of the year, or in                       
4 equal quarterly installments once every three months.
Example 1
A house of assessed annual value Rs. 36 000 is charged annual rates of 4%. Calculate 
the rates that have to be paid for a quarter.
                                     Annual rates  =  Rs.  36 000   
                                                  =  Rs. 1 440
  The rates that have to be paid for a quarter =  Rs.  1 440  4
       =  Rs. 360
         

140Example 2
The assessed annual value of a shop within the administrative domain of a certain 
urban council is Rs. 24 000. The quarterly rates payable on this property is Rs. 300. 
Calculate the rates percentage charged by the council.
            Assessed annual value of the shop  = Rs. 24 000 
                             Rates charged for a quarter  = Rs. 300 
                          Rates charged for the year  = Rs. 300  4
       = Rs. 1 200
            Accordingly, the rates percentage charged =  100%
       
               =  5%
                                                                                             
Customs Duty
When certain items are imported or exported, a certain percentage of the value of 
the item has to be paid as taxes to the government. Such taxes are called customs 
duty. This tax is charged by Sri Lanka Customs.
Individuals who have worked abroad are entitled to a duty free quota on their return, 
which may be used to purchase certain items without paying customs duty, from the 
duty free shops housed in the international airport. 
Further, certain government servants are entitled to a reduction in customs duty 
when importing vehicles.
Example 1
If customs duty of 10% of the value of the item has to be paid when a certain type 
of clock is imported, how much duty has to be paid when a clock of this type of 
value Rs. 5 000 is imported?
      Customs duty that has to be paid = Rs.  5 000      
      =  Rs. 500

141Example 2
When a car is imported, 60% of its value has to be paid as customs duty. Find the 
total amount with the duty included, that it costs a person to import a car worth           
Rs. 2 000 000.
Method 1
        Amount of customs duty that has to be paid   = Rs. 2 000 000    
                              = Rs.  1 200 000
 
Cost of the vehicle with the customs duty included   =  Rs. 2 000 000 + 1 200 000
                              =  Rs. 3 200 000
Method 2
Cost of the vehicle with the customs duty included  =  Rs. 2 000 000    160
100 
                      =  Rs. 3 200 000  
Example 3
If Rs. 18 000 was charged as customs duty when a stock of fruits worth Rs. 300 000 
was exported to the Middle East,   find the percentage of the value of the stock that 
the exporter had to pay as customs duty.
               The value of the stock of fruits  = Rs.  300 000                                                            
        Customs duty that was paid  = Rs .18 000
                   Percentage charged as customs duty  =  
                                           =  6% 
Example 4
The value of a television set with a 15% customs duty added to it is Rs. 28 750.  
What is the value of the television set without the duty?
    The value of the television set without the customs duty  = Rs. 28 750  
                                                = Rs. 25 000   

142Income Tax
The government imposes a tax on the annual income of an individual, which is 
earned as salary, from property or through a business, and which exceeds a certain 
limit. Such taxes are called income taxes.
The income tax for a particular year can either be paid annually or in quarterly 
installments. A table with the information on how the taxes are calculated, which 
was implemented in 2011 by the Inland Revenue Department is given below. (These 
values may change in the future)
  
Annual Income Tax Percentage
Initial Rs.  500 000 Tax free
Next Rs.  500 000 4%
Next Rs.  500 000 8%
Next Rs.  500 000 12%
Next Rs.  500 000 16%
Next Rs.  500 000 20%
Balance taxable income 24%
(Table 13.1)
This table is used to perform calculations related to the examples and problems on 
income tax in this lesson.
Example 1
If the annual income of an individual is Rs. 575 000, calculate the income tax he 
has to pay for the year.
           The annual income   = Rs. 575 000
        Tax free income  = Rs. 500 000
        Taxable income  = Rs. 575 000 − 500 000
                                 = Rs. 75 000
             Payable tax  = Rs. 75 000  
     = Rs. 3 000 

143Example 2
If the annual income of a certain businessman is Rs. 1 650 000, calculate the total 
annual income tax he has to pay.
First let us separate the annual income as shown below.
Annual 
income    Tax free             
income    4] tax  8] tax 12] tax 1,650 000 =  500 000  +  500 000  +  500 000  +  150 000
       
 
                Tax free income  =  Rs. 500 000
        Tax charged on the next Rs. 500 000    =  Rs. 500 000    
             =  Rs. 20 000
          Tax charged on the next Rs. 500 000  =  Rs. 500 000   
             =  Rs. 40 000
                 Tax charged on the next Rs. 150 000  =  Rs. 150 000   
             =  Rs. 18 000 
    Total income tax that has to be paid       = Rs. 20 000 + 40 000 + 18 000
                                                       = Rs. 78 000 
Value Added Tax (V AT)
When a product or a service is bought, a percentage of its total value is charged as 
value added tax. The trader who sells the product and the service provider who are 
both bound to pay this tax, charge it from the consumer.
Example 1
A certain person’s monthly telephone charges are Rs. 2 500. If a V AT of 15% is 
added to this charge, what is his monthly bill?

144Method 1  
        V AT = Rs.  2 500          Method 2
Rs. 2 500  
 
Rs. 2 875      
     = Rs. 375
           Total bill  = Rs. 2 500 + 375
     = Rs. 2 875
Example 2
The production cost of a pair of shoes produced by a certain organization is given 
below.
     Raw materials  = Rs. 1 200
     Labour   = Rs.    300
     Other expenses  = Rs.    200
     Total cost   = Rs. 1 700
The organization hopes to gain a profit of Rs. 250 from this product. A V AT of 15% 
has to be paid to the government on the price of the pair of shoes. Find the selling 
price of the pair of shoes with the V AT included.
      V AT that needs to be paid       = Rs. 1 950                  Method 2
Rs. 1 950  
 
Rs. 2 242.50 
        = Rs. 292.50
Selling price of the pair of shoes  --= Rs. 1950 + 292.50
        = Rs. 2 242.50

14.2 Interest
When a loan has been taken from an individual or an institution, the extra amount 
that has to be paid when settling the loan after a period of time is called the interest .  
Similarly, when money has been deposited in a bank or some other financial 
institution for a period of time, the extra amount that is received at the end of the 
period is also called the interest .
Usually, the interest that has to be paid for a year is a percentage of the loan amount 
(or deposit amount). This percentage is called the annual interest rate .  The interest 
rate can also be given monthly or semi-annually.
Simple Interest
When calculating the interest for a specific period, if only the initial amount 
(principal) is taken into consideration, then such interest is called simple interest .
Example 1
It took a man 2 years to settle a loan of Rs. 5 000 borrowed at an annual simple 
interest rate of 10%. How much interest did he pay in total?
       Simple interest paid for a year  = Rs. 5 000   
          = Rs. 500
    Simple interest paid for two years  = Rs. 500  2
      = Rs. 1 000  

147Example 2
Find the total amount that Senal has to pay to settle a loan in three months, if he 
borrowed  Rs. 8 000 at a monthly simple interest rate of 2%.
            Interest for a month    = Rs. 8 000  
      = Rs. 160
          Interest for three months  = Rs. 160  3
      = Rs. 480
   Since total amount  = Loan + Interest,
total amount to be paid in three months  = Rs. 8 000 + 480
      = Rs. 8 480
Example 3
How long will it take for a person who gave a loan of Rs 10 000 at an annual simple 
interest rate of 12%, to receive an interest of Rs. 3 600?
  Simple interest received for a year  = Rs. 10 000  
      = Rs. 1 200
 Number of years it takes to 
receive Rs. 3 600 as interest = 
     
      = 3 years
Example 4
If the simple interest that had to be paid for two years, on a loan of Rs.7 500 was  
Rs.1 200, find the annual simple interest rate that was charged.
             Interest for two years  =  Rs.1 200
             Interest for a year   =  Rs.1 200   2
      =  Rs.600
       Annual simple interest rate  =  600
7500  100%
      =  8%
Example 5                                        
How many years after taking a loan of Rs. 25 000 at an annual simple interest rate 
of 7.5%, does a person have to pay a total amount of Rs. 28 750 to settle the loan?
             Interest for a year  =  Rs. 25 000  7.5
100     
     =  Rs. 1 875
    Loan =  Rs. 25 000
        Total amount to be paid =  Rs. 28 750

148                  Total interest to be paid  = Rs. 28 750 − 25 000
       = Rs. 3 750
           Time period for which interest has to be paid  = 
       = 2 years
Example 6    
If the total amount that had to be paid after 4 months to settle a loan borrowed at a 
monthly simple interest rate of 1.5% was Rs.5 300, find the loan amount.
The meaning of “A monthly simple interest rate of 1.5%” is that “Rs.1.50 has to be 
paid as interest for a month for a loan amount of Rs 100.
                 That is, interest paid for 1 month on a loan of Rs.100    = Rs '1.50
        Interest paid for 4 months on a loan of Rs. 100     = Rs '1.50 « 4 = Rs'6 
  Total amount paid in 4 months for a loan of Rs. 100      = Rs '100 + 6 = Rs'106
     Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs '106  =  Rs'100
                                           has to be paid after 4 months  
   Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs. 5300   =    
                                            has to be paid after 4 months
             = Rs.5000

By studying this lesson you will be able to 
 ² construct and solve simple equations with algebraic fractions
 ² construct and solve simultaneous equations  
 ² solve quadratic equations using factors
 Solving simple equations
Let us work on the following exercise in order to revise the knowledge we have 
acquired on solving simple equations.
Review Exercise
1. Solve the following equations.
 15.1  Solving simple equations described further:
Let us learn how to construct and solve an equation.
Did you observe that some of the equations in the above exercise contain fractions. 
The unknown term ( x, y, p, a) was in the numerator of the fraction?. Now we are 
going to construct and solve equations with fractions of which the unknown term is 
in the denominator. Let us construct and solve such an equation.
Twelve is divided by two numbers of which the value of one number is double that 
of the other. The difference between the two quotients is 2. Find the two numbers.
Let us examine how this problem can be solved by the trial and error method.
Case I:   Can the two numbers be 2 and 4?
 , so the difference is  6 – 3 = 3, and they do not work.

151Case II: Can the two numbers be 6 and 12?  
 and , so the difference is  2 – 1 = 1, and they do not work.
Case III:  Can the two numbers be 3 and 6?
  and , so the difference is   4 – 2 = 2, and they work!
Thus, the problem can be solved using the method of trial and error. However, 
for some problems, the trial and error method is too long. Also, some problems 
cannot be solved by trial and error method. A suitable method of solving this type of 
problems is by using equations. Now, let us see how it can be solved by constructing 
an equation.
Suppose 12 is divided by a number x and its double 2 x.
Then the quotient of 12 divided by x is  .
 
The quotient of 12 divided by twice the x, i.e., 2 x, is  .
Because the difference between the two quotients is 2, we get  '
The value of x obtained by solving this equation gives us the required number. Let 
us solve this equation. This is an equation having fractions with algebraic terms 
in the denominator. The first fraction contains x in the denominator. The second 
fraction has 2 x in the denominator. Let us make the denominators of both fractions 
equal. The easiest way to do this is by replacing  by the equivalent fraction  
, which is  . 
Then, 
                         ∴
 Multiplying both sides by  2x 
i.e., 
i.e.,Dividing both sides by 4 
It follows that the two numbers are 3 and 6.

152Note:This equation can be solved by writing the equation  as 12 = 4 x by 
cross multiplication too.  
Example 1
Several friends shared 60 mangoes equally. One of them, Amal, sold three of his 
mangoes, and then he had only two mangoes left. How many friends shared the 
mangoes?
In reality, this problem can easily be solved mentally. Nevertheless, let us solve this 
equation as follows just to illustrate the construction and solving of equations.
Let x be the number of friends.
Then, the number of mangoes one person obtains = 
Number of mangoes Amal sold           = 3
Then, the number of mangoes left           = 
Since he had only two left, we may write, 
           = 2 
Let us now solve this equation.
Let us add 3 to both sides.          − 3 + 3 = 2 + 3 
                  ∴   = 5 
        Then, 5 x = 60
       Hence, x = 12.
Therefore, 12 friends shared mangoes.
Observe how the following equations are solved.

Exercise 15.1
1. A father and his sons equally shared an amount of Rs 270. Then the amount each 
person had was Rs 45. Taking the number of sons as x, construct an equation. 
Solve this equation and hence find the number of sons the father has.
2. When the same number was added both to the numerator and the denominator of 
the fraction  , the resulting fraction was equal to  9' What number was added?
3. Solve the following equations.
   
 

154 15.2 Simultaneous Equations
Consider the following pair of simultaneous equations
    
The coefficient of the unknown x in each of the equations is 2. That means, they are 
equal. We have seen how to solve simultaneous equations of this nature, i.e., when 
the coefficients of one unknown are equal. Let us see how simultaneous equations 
are solved when the coefficients of both unknowns are un equal, i.e., the coefficients 
of each unknown are different.
Example 1:
Sajithi and Sanjana have certain amounts of money. When twice the amount of 
money Sanjana has is added to the amount of money Sajithi has, we get Rs. 110. 
When thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to twice the amount of 
money Sajithi has, the amount is Rs. 190. Find the amount of money each has.
Let us see how simultaneous equations can be used to solve this problem. Let the 
amount of money Sajithi has be Rs. x and the amount of money Sanjana has be 
Rs. y. Then, the sum of the amount of money Sajithi has and twice the amount of 
money Sanjana has is Rs. x + 2y. Because this amount is equal to Rs. 110, we get
  x + 2y = 110   1
Also, the sum of twice the amount of money Sajithi has and thrice the amount of 
money Sanjana has is Rs. 2 x + 3y. Because this amount is equal to Rs 190, we get
2x + 3y =  190  2
The coefficients of neither x nor of y of the equations (1) and (2) are equal. 
Therefore, let us equate the coefficients of one of the unknowns. In order to make 
the coefficient of x in the first equation 2, let us multiply that equation by 2. Then 
we get
       2x + 4y = 220  3
Now, the coefficients of x in both equations are equal.
Therefore, from  3  and 2 , we get,
              
     2 x + 4y – (2 x + 3y) = 220 – 190
        2x + 4y – 2x – 3y = 30
           y   = 30
Substituting the value of y in the first equation,    

1552= 110 +xy
Therefore, the amount of money Sajithi has is Rs 50 and the amount of money 
Sanjana has is Rs 30.
Example 2
Solve: 2 m + 3n = 13
 3 m + 5n = 21
 
Let us denote the two equations as
 2m + 3n = 13   1 
 3 m + 5n = 21   2    
       
 From 1 × 3, we get,  6m + 9n   = 39 3
 From 2 × 2, we get,  6m + 10 n = 42 4
Then, from  4  and 3, we get,
6m + 10 n – (6m + 9n) = 42 – 39
   6m + 10 n – 6m – 9n = 3
                n = 3
Substituting n = 3 in (1), we get
 2m + 3n   = 13
 2 m + 3×3 = 13
           2 m  = 13 – 9
           2 m  = 4
  m  = 2
i.e.,  m = 2 and n = 3
Example 3
The price of two oranges and one king coconut is Rs. 80. Three king coconuts cost  
the same amount as two oranges. Find the price of an orange and a king coconut 
separately.
Let us construct two equations from the given information.
Let the price of one orange be Rs. x and that of a king coconut be Rs. y.

156Then, the price of two oranges and a king coconut is 2 x + y. Since this is equal to 
Rs. 80, we get
 2 x + y = 80.
Because the price of two oranges is equal to that of three king coconut, we get,
 2 x = 3y.
Let us denote the equations as
     2x + y = 80 1 
         2x = 3y 2 
These two equations can be solved just the way we did in the previous example, by 
writing the second equation as 2 x – 3y = 0. However, there is an easier way to do it 
in this case. That is, substituting from one equation to the other.
Substitute 3 y from equation (2) for 2 x in equation (1) to get
  3y + y  = 80
         4 y = 80
           y = 20
Substitute y = 20 in (1) to get
    2x + 20 = 80
            2 x = 60
              x = 30 
Therefore, the price of one orange is Rs. 30 and that of a king coconut is Rs. 20.
Example 4
Solve:            x = 3y
          2 x + 3y = 18 
Denote the two equations as
           x = 3y  1
2x + 3y = 18  2 
Substitute for x in equation (2) from equation (1) to get 
2 « (3y) + 3 y = 18
      6 y + 3y = 18
              9 y = 18
                y = 2          
Substitute y = 2 in (1) to get
 x  = 3y
 x  = 3 « 2
 x  = 6
i.e., x = 6 and y = 2.

 15.3 Quadratic Equations
An equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation where a ≠ 0. 
The terms b and c might be 0. Observe the following equations.
  ^i& x2 + 5x + 6 = 0
 ^ii& 2x2 – 5x = 0
^iii& x2 –  9 = 0
Each of the above equations is a quadratic equation since a ≠ 0, whereas c = 0 in the 
second equation and b = 0 in the third equation.
Before solving the quadratic equations, let us consider the following:
   • When any number is multiplied by zero, the product is zero.
• If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers is zero.
So, let us see for what values of x the expression ( x – 1)(x –  3) is zero. The expression 
is zero only when x – 1= 0 or x – 3 = 0, that is, only when x =1 or x = 3.
Now, consider the equation ( x– 1)(x – 3) = 0. The values x = 1 and x = 3 satisfy this 

158equation. Then, 1 and 3 are called the roots of this equation.
Now, consider the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0.
Since x2 + 5x + 6 = ( x + 3)( x + 2), the equation can be rewritten as ( x + 3)( x + 2) = 0.
Then, x + 3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0.
There fore, x = –3 and x = –2 satisfy the equation. This can be verified as follows.
When x = –3, 
        x2 + 5x + 6  =  ^–3&2 + 5^–3& + 6 
         = 9 + ^–15& + 6
         = 0
When x = –2 , 
                x2 + 5x +6  = ^–2&2 + 5^–2& + 6
         = 4 + ^–10& + 6
         = 0
Thus, the roots of the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are –3 and –2. In other words, the 
solutions of the equation are x = –3 and x = –2.
Example 1
Solve the equation   x2 + 2x  = 0
      x2 + 2x  = 0
          x ^x + 2& = 0
            x = 0  or  x + 2 = 0 
               x = 0  or  x = – 2  
Hence, x = 0 and x = –2 are the solutions of the given equation.
Example 2 
Solve the equation  x2 – 3x + 2 = 0
                    x2 – 3x + 2 = 0
                 ^ x – 1&  ^x – 2& = 0
            x – 1 = 0 or x – 2 = 0
 x  = 1  or  x = 2 
 Hence, x = 1 and x = 2 are the solutions of the given equation.

159Example 3 
Solve the equation x2 – 4x – 21 = 0
                 x2 – 4x – 21 = 0
       ^ x – 7& ^x + 3& = 0
x – 7 = 0  or  x + 3 = 0
              x  = 7 or x = – 3
Hence,  x = 7 and x =  – 3  are the solutions of the given equation.
Note: When there are two factors to a quadratic expression, there are two distinct 
roots to the that equation. 
Exercise 15.3
Solve each of the following quadratic equations.
     ^ a& ^x – 2& ^ x – 3&  = 0   ^b&  ^ x + 2& ^ x – 5& = 0

Do the following activities first to identify the properties of parallelograms.

² What can you say about the lengths of the pair of opposite sides PQ and SR,            
as well as the lengths of PS and QR?
It should be clear to you that PQ = SR and PS = QR.

3. Now copy the parallelogram PQRS  onto a piece of tissue paper, and using it draw 
two copies of PQRS  and cut them out.  
² In one parallelogram, draw the diagonal PR. 
²  Now cut this parallelogram along the diagonal and see whether the two triangles 
that you obtain coincide.
It should be clear to you that the two triangles coincide.  Therefore, the areas of the 
two triangles are equal. Similarly, use the other parallelogram you cut out to verify 
that the areas of the two triangles obtained by cutting the parallelogram along the 
other diagonal are also equal.
According to the above activity,  
  The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the opposite angles of a 
parallelogram are equal, and the area of the parallelogram is bisected by each 
diagonal.

² What can you say about the lengths of OB and OD?
² It should be clear to you that OA = OC  and that OB = OD .
Accordingly, it is clear that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

   (i) opposite sides are equal.
  (ii) opposite angles are equal.
            (iii) the area of the parallelogram is bisected by each diagonal.

 By studying this lesson you will be able to
         identify the conditions that need to be satisfied for a quadrilateral to be a 
parallelogram.  
  Theorem: If the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a   
        parallelogram.
                                                                                                                 
For example, in the given figure,  AB = DC  and      A
D CB 8 cm
8 cm5 cm5 cm  AD = BC . 
Therefore, ABCD  is a parallelogram.
              
Let us engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the above theorem.
Activity 1
• Draw  as shown in the figure, such that the sides of the angle are of length                
5 cm and 3 cm.    
                                                                  D

5 cm                                                     
• As shown in the second figure, obtain the point C 
which is 3 cm from B and 5 cm from D.
• Now complete the quadrilateral ABCD .
• Then it can be seen that AB = DC  and AD = BC.

• By using a set square and a ruler or by measuring 
the angles and obtaining that the sum of a pair of 
allied angles is 180o, observe that the opposite sides 
of the quadrilateral are parallel. That is, obtain that                
AB//DC  and AD//BC .
  It can be observed that in a quadrilateral with opposite side equal, the opposite 
sides are parallel too.

170Theorem: If the opposite angles of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a   
       parallelogram.

For example, in the given figure, since  
and , by the  
theorem, PQRS  is a  parallelogram.
Let us engage in the following activity to establish the truth of the above theorem.

• Check whether the opposite pairs of angles of each quadrilateral are equal.
• Check whether the pairs of opposite sides are parallel in the quadrilateral with 
opposite angles equal. (See whether the sum of the allied angles is 180o.)
 Accordingly, observe that in the quadrilateral with opposite angles equal, the 
opposite sides are parallel to each other. 
Theorem: If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then it is a            
       parallelogram.

OFor example, in the quadrilateral ABCD , since             
AO = OC  and BO = OD, according to the theorem,   
ABCD  is a parallelogram.

Activity 3
• To draw the quadrilateral ABCD  with diagonals AC and BD, first draw the 
diagonal AC and name its midpoint O.
• Now draw another straight line segment such that it intersects the diagonal AC at 
O. Mark the points B and D on this line segment such that OB = OD .

• Now complete the quadrilateral ABCD  as shown above.
• Check whether the sides AB and DC as well as the sides BC and AD in the 
quadrilateral ABCD  are parallel to each other by using a set square and a ruler or 
by measuring a pair of alternate angles.
Accordingly, it can be seen that if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, 
then the opposite sides are parallel to each other.

above theorem.

method.

a protractor, or by using a set square and ruler, observe 
that AD and BC are parallel to each other.
Accordingly, it can be seen that in a quadrilateral, if a pair of opposite sides is equal 
and parallel, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
Now, by considering the following example, let us see how riders are proved using 
the above theorems.
Example 1
T is the midpoint of the side  BC of the triangle  ABC. The straight line drawn through 
C, parallel to  AB meets  AT produced at  D.  Prove that ABDC is a parallelogram.
First, let us draw the figure according to the given information.

We know that in a quadrilateral, if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel, 
then it is a parallelogram. Therefore, let us show that ABDC  is a parallelogram by 
showing that a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel. It is given that AB//CD .   
Let us show that AB = CD .
To obtain this, let us show that the triangles ABT and CTD  are congruent.

Since corresponding elements of congruent triangles are equal,
  AB = CD.
Since   AB = CD  and AB // CD , we obtain that ABDC  is a parallelogram.

     By studying this lesson, you will be able to
 • identify methods of describing sets
 • identify the regions in a Venn diagram when at most two sets  
 are represented in the Venn diagram and solve problems using the formula 
relating the number of elements in these sets.
 
Set Notation
You have learnt three methods of describing sets before. They are
 • the descriptive method
 • the method of listing elements
 • the Venn diagram method.
Let A be the set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. Then, A can be denoted using 
the above three methods as follows:
• As a description,
  A = {multiples of 3 between 1 and 10} or
  A = set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10.
• Listing the elements
A = {3, 6, 9}
• In a Venn diagram,

18.1 Set Builder Method
Set builder method is another method to describe sets. The set of all multiples of 3 
between 1 and 10 can be denoted using the set builder method as follows:
 A = { x : x is a multiple of 3 and 1< x < 10}.
The symbol x here is like a variable. You may use any symbol in place of x. The 
statement after the colon describes how the elements should be. There are several 
ways a set can be represented using the set builder method. For example, the 
following are three different ways of denoting the set A = {1, 2} using the set 
builder method.Sets 18

18. 2 Regions in a Venn Diagram
In Venn diagrams, the universal set is represented by a rectangular region and is 
denoted by ε.                                 ε                                 
    
The subsets of the universal set are represented by circular (or elliptical) regions. 
These subsets give rise to several regions in the Venn diagram that represents the 
universal set. Now let us investigate these regions.
1. When there is one subset represented in the universal set.
    
     Aε
          
The subset  A divides the universal set into two regions which are shaded in the next 
figure.The subsets corresponding to these regions can be denoted by  A and A using 
set notation .Z     

180 181A
       A
                    A                                           Complement of A = A
2. When two subsets are represented in the Venn diagram
Let A and B be the two subsets. When there are no common elements in A and B, 
that is, when  A∩B = O, and when there are common elements in A and B, that is 
when A∩BO, the relevant Venn diagrams are shown below.                                    
 A Bε
 A B A Bε
 
        O        O  
Before investigating the regions let us recall the following definitions.
    A =  Set of elements not in A
 = Set of elements belonging to both  A and B
 = Set of elements belonging to A or B (or both)
As an example, let us take  ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} 
      A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and
      B = {2, 3, 5, 7} 
Then, we can represent the above information in a Venn diagram as given below.

A B
According to the given information, it is clear that 
           A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} 
        = {2} and
           = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10} 
Also, when we observe the Venn diagram we can see that
          ( ) = {1, 9} and
             ( ) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} ε ε

180 181Two subsets of a universal set represented in a Venn diagram give rise to several 
regions ' Some such regions and the way they can be written down using set 
complement, set intersection and set union are shown below.

182 183Exercise 18.2
1. a. Shade the region denoted by each of the following sets in separate Venn 
diagrams.
 
B A              
   (i)  A∩B         (ii) A     B
 (iii) ( A∩B)                (iv) ( AB)
  (v) (A∩B)  (AB)         (vi) ( A∩B) 
(vii) ( A∩B)                              (viii) ( A  B)
  (ix) (A    B) 
 
b. By investigating the regions you shades in part (a) above, find all pairs of 
equal sets.
2. Shown below is the Venn diagram of two sets A and B where . In 6 copies 
of this Venn diagram, shade each of the given 6 regions.

3. The information on the children in a society is shown in the following Venn 
diagram. (The letters a, b, c  and d indicate the regions in which the letters are 
written.)
 a b c
dAge above 10 
yearsgirls
Describe in words the regions indicated by each of the letters a, b, c  and d. For 
example, the boys whose ages are above 10 years are indicated by a.
4. Let ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    A∩B  = {4, 5}
    A∩B   = {3}
  (AB)  = {1}
 Include the above information in a suitable Venn diagram and hence find A,                     
AB  and B∩A. 

182 18318.3 Relationship between the numbers of elements in two sets 
Shown below is a Venn diagram with two subsets A and B of the universal set such 
that A∩BO. Here n1, n2 and n3 denote the number of elements in the respective 
regions. (Though it is expected to write the elements inside the regions, we have 
written down the number of elements for ease.)  
 
  n1n2n3 A B
     
Let us the denote the number of elements belonging to the subset A by n( A) etc. 
Then, from the figure, we see that 
               n (A) = n1 + n2
                                    n (B) = n2 + n3
                           n (A∩B) = n2
                n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n3  
Now, we write,   n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n2 + n3 – n2     
                                       =  n (A) + n (B)  –  n (A∩B)                          
Thus, we obtain the formula
   n (A∪B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A∩B)
The Venn diagram when the two subsets A and B are disjoint (i.e.,when 
A∩B = O) is shown below. 
  n1n2B A
  
In this case, we see that
 n (A) = n1
 n (B) = n2
       n (A∪B) = n1 + n2}}

184 185Thus, when Owe obtain the formula 
             n (A∪B) = n (A) + n (B)
Example 1
Information on the numbers of students who participate in football and cricket 
are shown in the following diagram (In this case too, the numbers in the regions 
indicate the numbers of students in the regions).         
 875
15 Football
  (F)Cricket
  (C) ε
 
How many students are
1. participating in football? n (F) =  8 +7 = 15
2. participating in cricket?   n (C) = 7 + 15 = 22   
3. participating in both sports (both football and cricket)? n (F ∩ C) = 7
4. participating in cricket only?  n (C ∩ F  ) = 15   
5. participating in football only?   n (F ∩ C ) = 8
6. participating in football or cricket (or both)? n (F ∪ C) = 8 + 7 + 15 = 30
7. not participating in football?  n (F ) = 15 + 5 = 20
8. not participating in cricket?  n (C ) = 8 + 5 = 13       
9. participating in exactly in one of the two sports?  n {(F ∩ C  ) ∪  (F   ∩ C )}   
                               = 8 + 15 = 23
10. Participating in neither of the two sports?  n (F ∪ C) = 5

184 185(a) How many farmers are growing
 1. vegetables? n (Y) = 25         
 2. paddy? n (X) = 7 + 25 = 32   
 3. only paddy?  n (Y∩X) = 7   
 4. only vegetables?   n(X∩Y) = 0 
 5. both vegetables and paddy? n (X∩Y) = 25
 6. vegetables or paddy? n (X∪Y) = 7 + 25 = 32   
 7. neither of the two crops? n (X∪Y) = 13                                   
(b) How many farmers were surveyed?
