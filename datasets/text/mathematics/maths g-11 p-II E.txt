Introduction
Our  daily household expenses fall into two main categories as capital expenses 
and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are the expenses we incur on  a regular 
basis and would  include our spending on food, clothes, medicine and electricity 
bills.
Capital expenses are  one-time expenses that are  not repeated on a regular basis.   
For instance   our spending on purchasing a land, a house, a vehicle, machinery or 
furniture is a capital expense.  Such  purchases are generally of significant value 
and may often require a loan from the place of work or from a financial institution.                            Percentages 09
By studying this lesson, you will be able to:
• compute the loan instalment when the interest is computed on the reducing 
balance.
• compute the interest rate calculated on the reducing balance  given the loan 
instalment.
• solve problems regarding compound interest.
For free distribution
2Money borrowed  as a loan is not paid back in full right away. Rather, it is  paid 
back over a long period of time as monthly  partial payments.Usually a loan is  
expected to be repaid with interest.  The part of the loan and the interest that is to be 
paid every month is referred to as a loan  instalment. However, some manufacturers 
or distributors may sell their merchandise on an interest free installment plan to 
promote sales.
Example 1 
A furniture manufacturer sells a Rs 30 000 worth wooden wardrobe on an interest 
free scheme of 12 monthly payments.What is the amount paid as an instalment?
       Instalment amount  = Rs 30 000
12
     = Rs  2 500
                    
Example  2 
A festival advance of Rs 5000 is given to employees of government institutions. 
This interest free advance has to be paid back in 10 equal monthly instalments. If 
each installment is deducted from the salary, what is the amount deducted from the 
salary each month?       
                           
The amount deducted from the monthly salary each month  = Rs 5 000
10
     
 = Rs 500
                                                      
9.1   Calculating interest on the reducing balance
There are several ways of charging interest on  a loan. Calculating the loan interest 
on the reducing balance is a common method. Let us explore this. 
When you borrow money to repay in monthly instalments, or if you purchase an 
item with a down payment with the understanding that the rest of the money will be 
paid in instalments, most of the time you will be expected to pay an interest on the 
loan. Here, the loan is paid in monthly instalments. The interest calculation is based 
on the outstanding loan  balance. That is the balance money  that remains in the 
borrowers  hands  as the loan is repaid during the loan term. As the borrower repays 
instalments, the remaining loan balance reduces over time. Interest is then charged 
only on the loan amount that the  borrower still holds. Therefore this method of 
calculating the interest is called, computing the interest on the reducing balance.
3Once the total interest to be paid is calculated, the monthly installments are 
determined, such that every installment is of the same value.
Study the following examples to understand the  method of calculating the  loan 
interest on the reducing balance and the value of an installment.
Example 1 
Mr Wickramasinghe has borrowed Rs 30 000 as a business loan from a bank that 
charges an annual interest rate of 24%. The loan has to be paid back in six equal 
monthly instalments and the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Calculate  
the value of a monthly instalment.  
       The loan amount  = Rs 30 000
     Amount due from the principal loan per month without interest  = Rs 30 000
6
     
 = Rs 5 000                                                               
In this method, the outstanding loan balance is reduced by Rs 5000 every month 
and interest is charged only on the loan balance.
Annual interest rate   = 24%
    Monthly interest rate    = 2%
 Interest charged for the first month  = Rs 30 000   2
100
 = Rs 600
Interest charged for the second month  = Rs 25 000   2
100 
    
    
 = Rs 500
Interest charged for the third month  = Rs 20 000   2
100 = Rs 400
 
  Interest charged for the fourth month  = Rs 15 000   2
100     
 = Rs 300
Interest charged for the fifth month = Rs 10 000   2
100        
        = Rs 200
4   Interest charged for the sixth month   = Rs 5 000   2
100     
                                                               = Rs 100
       The total interest paid  = Rs 600 + 500 + 400 + 300 + 200 + 100
 = Rs 2 100
Total amount to be paid after 6 months  = loan without interest  + interest
 The total amount paid  = Rs 30 000 + 2 100
 = Rs 32 100
 ...  value of a monthly installment  = Rs 32 100  .. 6
 = Rs 5 350
  
Calculating the interest as in the above method could be lengthy and time consuming.
Therefore we adopt the following easier method to calculate the interest.
Interest charged on amount due per month from the principal  
 loan  = Rs 5 000   2
100       
      
 = Rs100
Therefore,
the total interest paid  = Rs 100    6 + 100    5  + 100    4 + 100    3 + 100    2 + 100    1   
    = Rs 100 (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)
    = Rs 100    21 
    = Rs 2 100
where 21 is the total number of portions of the loan that is to be paid within the six 
months.We will call this the number of month units. We calculate the number of 
month units as
 month units = 6 + 5 + 4  + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21
This can be thought of as a sum of an arithmetic progression and can be found using 
the formulan
2 (a + l ). Then
         month units =  6
2 (6 + 1)
     =  3  7
     =  21
5That is,   
month units =   number of instalments
2  ^number of instalments + 1 &
Example  2 
A television priced at Rs 25 000 can be purchased by making a down payment of 
Rs 7 000 and paying the remainder by 12 equal monthly installments. If an annual 
interest rate of 18% is charged on the loan,where the interest is calculated on the 
reducing balance, find the value of a monthly installment.
Price of the television  = Rs 25 000
The down payment  = Rs 7 000
∴   Balance to be paid in installments  = Rs 25 000 – 7 000
 = Rs 18 000 
Duration of the loan  = 12 month
 ∴   Portion of the loan paid in one month = Rs 18 000  .. 12 
 = Rs 1 500
∴ Interest paid for a month  unit   = Rs 1 500    18
100     1
12  
 = Rs 22.50
The number of month units the loan is paid over =  12
2 (12 + 1)
 = 6  13
 = 78
∴ Total interest paid   = Rs 22.50   78
 = Rs 1 755
∴ Total amount paid  = Rs 18 000 + 1 755
 = Rs 19 755
∴  The amount of an installment = Rs 19 755  .. 12 
 = Rs1 646.25
            
Example  3 
The following advertisement was displayed in a shop:
A washing machine worth Rs 30 000 is available for a down payment of                             
Rs 5000 and 10 equal monthly instalments of Rs 2720. 
If the interest on the loan was calculated on the reducing loan balance, calculate the 
interest rate.
6                    Price of the washing machine  = Rs 30 000
                        The down payment    = Rs 5 000
  Balance to be paid in installments  = Rs 30 000 – 5 000
   = Rs 25 000 
Portion of the loan paid according to the one month = Rs 25 000  ..10 
   = Rs 2 500
  The amount paid according to the installment plan  = Rs 2 720   10
   = Rs 27 200
     Total interest paid = Rs 27 200 – 25 000
   = Rs 2 200
   The number of month units the loan is paid over =  10
2 (10 + 1)
   = 55
     Interest for a monthly unit = Rs 2 200  .. 55
   = Rs 40
    The annual interest rate   =   40
2 500  100%   12
   = 19.2%

interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual 
interest rate.
 9.2 Compound Interest
An alternative way of calculating interest for an amount of money borrowed or 
deposited is the compound interest method. Let us explore how the interest is 
calculated under this method through an example. 
At a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 10%, the account statement provided 
at the end of 3 years, to a person who has maintained a Rs 25 000 fixed account is 
as follows.
8Date Description Deposits  (Rs) Interest (Rs)
2013.01.01 cash deposit 25 000.00 _
2013.12.31 interest _ 2 500.00
2014.01.01 balance 27 500.00 _
2014.12.31 interest _ 2 750.00
2015.01.01 balance 30 250.00 _
2015.12.31 interest _ 3 025.00
2016.01.01 balance 33 275. 00 _
According to the above statement the depositor has earned Rs 2 500 as interest in 
the year 2013. It is clear that the interest earned is 10% of the principal deposit.
The sum of the money deposited in 2013 and the interest earned in the year 2013 
that amounts to 27 500 is considered as the total in the account on 2014.01.01. 
Furthermore, the interest earned in the year 2014 is 2750 and it is 10% of the total                         
Rs 27500. It is apparent that the interest earned at the end of the year is added to the 
account balance and the interest for the next year is calculate on the new balance.  
In this manner, when the interest is calculated every year, not only the principal 
but the previously earned interest also earns interest. The addition of interest to the 
principal is called compounding and the interest calculation on the compounded 
amount is called the compound interest  method.
The compound interest method can be used when calculating interest on a loan as 
well as on a deposit.
Example  1 
If a person takes a loan of Rs 10 000 at a compound interest rate of   10% per  year, 
calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.
           Loan amount  = Rs 10 000 
  Compound interest rate   = 10%
       Interest for the first year  = Rs 10 000    10
100      = Rs 1 000
        Loan amount at the end of the first year  = Rs 10 000 + 1 000
      = Rs 11 000 
              Interest for the second year  = Rs 11 000    10
100 
      = Rs 1 100
   Loan amount at the end of the second year  = Rs 11 000 + 1 100
 = Rs 12 100
9As in the above example, compound interest can be calculated separately for each year 
and added to the loan amount to find the total loan amount due.
Example  2 
Amal invests Rs 50 000 for 3 years in a fixed deposit account which pays 6% annual 
interest compounded yearly. Nimal invests Rs 50 000 in an account which pays 6% 
annual simple interest. Calculate the amounts received by Amal and Nimal at the end 
of three years separately.
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the first year = Rs 50 000    106
100
  = Rs 53 000.00
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the second year = Rs 53 000    106
100
  = Rs 56 180.00
Total amount received by Amal at the end of the third year = Rs 56 180    106
100
  = Rs 59 550.80
              
Interest received by Nimal at the end of the third year = Rs 50 000      6
100 3
  = Rs 9 000.00
Total amount received by Nimal at the end of three years = Rs 9 000 + 50 000
  = Rs 59 000.00
      
Total amount received by Amal at the end of three years can also be obtained by 
 
Rs 50 000    106
100  106
100  106
100
= Rs 59 550.80 .
Exercise 9.2
1.  If a person takes a loan of Rs 5 000 at a compound interest rate of 5% per year, 
calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.
2.  If a person deposits Rs  6 000 into an account paying 7% annual interest compounded 
yearly, how much money will be in the account after 2 years?
103. Radha deposits Rs 8 000 in an account paying 12% annual interest compounded 
yearly. After one year the bank interest rate drops to 10%. How much money 
will Radha receive in total as interest at the end of 2 years?
4. Hashan and Caseem are two friends. If Hashan lends Rs 25 000 at a simple 
annual interest rate of 15% and Caseem lends 25 000 at an interest rate of 14% 
compounded yearly on the same date, calculate who receives more money after 
three years.
5. At the beginning of a year a  person  deposits Rs 40 000 in a bank that pays 12% 
annual interest compounded every six month (semi annually). Compute how 
much money in total he receives at the end of the year.
6.  A person who has loaned a certain amount at 8% interest compounded yearly, 
receives Rs 432 as compound interest at the end of two years. Find the amount 
that he loaned.
Miscellaneous  Exercise

24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated 
on the reducing balance.
(a) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought outright for cash?
(b) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought on an instalment plan?
(c)  How profitable is it to buy the TV outright for cash than on an installment 
plan?

Introduction
In this lesson we will consider businesses in Sri Lanka which are incorporated 
companies registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.  These companies 
may be owned by an individual or a group of individuals. Of these companies, the 
companies which are limited by shares can be classified as follows.
 ² Private limited companies
 ² Public limited companies
Public limited companies raise capital to commence or continue their business by 
issuing shares or debentures to the general public. The public is notified regarding 
the issue of shares through the media. When the public buy shares, they have the 
right to sell these shares to others.  The stock market is where the trading of these 
shares occurs.
Stock Market
The Stock Market (Stock Exchange) is a place where securities such as shares and 
debentures issued by companies are traded. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is 
the organization responsible for the operation of the stock market in Sri Lanka. The 
CSE is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to 
operate as a stock market in Sri Lanka. The SEC regulates and oversees the stock 
market. Companies are admitted to the official list of the CSE as listed companies.  
On April 21st 2015 there were 297 companies listed in the Sri Lankan stock market. 
The public who wish to buy or sell securities in the stock market must register 
with one or more of the 15 licensed stockbroker firms of the CSE who attend to the 
transactions. Some brokers offer trading through the internet.
1210.1 Shares
Public limited companies which are listed in the stock market, that wish to raise 
capital by involving the public, do this by issuing “shares”. A share is one of the 
equal parts into which a company’s stated capital is divided.
When a company issues new shares, the price of a share is decided by the company 
itself. The public can invest in as many shares as they like. An investor who buys 
shares in a company becomes a part owner of that company. The stake he has in the 
company is proportional to the number of shares he owns.
To understand this further, consider the following example.
An investor buys 10 000 shares from the 100 000 shares issued to the public by a 
certain company. Then the investor has a share of  100   00010 0 00 in the company. Let us 
express this as a percentage.
 100   00010 0 00 100]  = 10].  
Therefore, the investor has 10% ownership of the company.
Example  1 
Company C which has a stated capital of Rs 10 000 000, issues 100 000 shares to 
the public at Rs 100 per share. Vishwa buys 5000 of these shares.
  (i)  Express Vishwa’s share in the company,
                  (a) as a fraction 
       (b)  as a percentage.
 (ii)  Find the amount that Vishwa invested in company C.
 
 
 (i)  Total number of shares issued by the company   = 100 000
Number of shares Vishwa bought = 5 000
  (a)  Vishwa’s share in the company as a fraction  =  100  0005 0 00 = 1
20   
  
13    (b)  Vishwa’s share in the company as a percentage  = 1
20  100]                           
= 5]
                                                    
 (ii)             Price of a share   = Rs 100
             The number of shares Vishwa purchased   = 5 000
  The amount Vishwa invested   = Rs 100  5 000
= Rs 500 000
                                    
Dividends
When a listed company issues new shares, it gives notice of the benefits that 
shareholders will enjoy. Dividends are payments out of the earnings of the company 
which some companies give their shareholders as a benefit. It is expressed in terms 
of the amount paid per share.  This is paid out quarterly or annually.
For example, a company may pay its shareholders annual dividends of Rs 5 per 
share. The company has the right to change this amount with time. 
Let us consider again the above example to clarify this further.
Example  1 
Company C pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, for the Rs 100 shares it issued, 
of which Vishwa bought 5 000 shares.
 (i)  Find the annual income that Vishwa receives through this investment.
 (ii)  Express Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage of the amount he
        invested.
 (i) The number of shares Vishwa owns  = 5000
  Annual dividends per share  = Rs  4 
                  ... Vishwa’s annual income =  Rs  5000  4    
    =  Rs  20 000
               
 
(ii)   Amount that Vishwa invested         = Rs 100  5 000
    ...Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage    = 50  0            000 20 000 100] 
                         
Now do the following exercise pertaining to the facts on initial investments in 
shares.        = Rs 500 000

10.2  Trading in the stock market
We learnt earlier that only listed companies are able to trade their shares in the stock 
market. Let us consider the following note to learn about the trading of shares that 
is done after a listed company has issued new shares to the public.
Nethmi Limited Company which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share, issued 
100 000 shares to the public at Rs 10 per share at its initial offering. In a year, the 
value of these shares had increased in the stock market to Rs 20 per share, at which 
time Nadeesha bought 1000 shares. A few years later, when the price of a share in 
this company had increased to Rs 28, Nadeesha sold her 1000 shares.
The primary market  is where investors buy new shares issued by a company. 
Shares can only be bought in the primary market, and the purchases are done 
directly from the issuing company at the initial price stated by the company itself. 
However, subsequent to the original issuance of shares in the primary market, 
trading of shares can be done by investors in the secondary market .  The price of 
a share in the secondary market is called the market price . The market price of a 
share varies with time depending on the demand.  
In the above example, the price of a share in Nethmi Limited Company increased 
from Rs 10 to Rs 20 in a year and subsequently after several years to Rs 28.  Such 
increases and decreases in the price of a share occur in the secondary market, where 
investors are able to trade their shares.
Capital Gain
The price at which a share is bought in a company at the initial offering or later at 
the market price is called the purchase price  of the share and the market price at 
which it is sold is called the selling price  of the share.
16When an investor sells shares he owns he may make a profit or incur a loss.  
When he sells his shares,
if the selling price > purchase price, then he makes a capital gain and 
the capital gain = selling price – purchase price.
Similarly, 
if the selling price < purchase price, then the investor incurs a capital loss and
the capital loss = purchase price – selling price.
Example 1 
Mr. Perera who invests in the stock market, bought 2000 shares in a certain company 
when the market price of a share was Rs 20. When the market price of a share 
increased to Rs 25, he sold all his shares.
 (i)  Find the amount Mr. Perera invested in the company.
 (ii)  Find the amount he made by selling the shares.
 (iii) Find his capital gain.
 (iv)  Express his capital gain as a percentage of his investment.
 (i) Amount invested in the company  = Rs 20  2 000
   = Rs 40 000
       
 (ii) Amount received by selling the shares  = Rs 25  2 000
   = Rs 50 000
      
 (iii)                                    Capital gain  = Rs 50 000 – 40 000
   = Rs10 000
      
 (iv) The capital gain as a percentage of the  =

The capital gain percentage mentioned in (iv) above can be calculated using the 
price of a share too.          
Purchase price of a share  =   Rs 20
Selling price of a share  =  Rs 25
17 ...capital gain as a percentage of the amount invested  =  2025 – 20 100]  
   =  205 100]  
    =  25]
                       
Example 2 
Mr. Mohamed spent a certain amount from the Rs 96 000 he had in hand, to buy 
shares at Rs 18 per share, in Company A which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 
per share. He spent the remaining amount to buy shares at Rs 21 per share, in 
Company B which pays annual dividends of Rs 3.50 per share. At the end of a year 
he received Rs 1000 more as annual dividends income from Company B, than the 
amount he received from Company A. 
     (i) By taking the amount that Mr. Mohamed invested in Company A as x,   
  construct an equation in x.    
   (ii) Find the amount he invested in each company by solving the above equation.
      (iii) Find the number of shares he had in each company.
      (iv)  Find the annual dividends income he received from each company.
After receiving the annual income, Mr. Mohamed sold all the shares he owns in 
both companies at the market price of Rs 20 per share.
  (v)  Find the total amount he made by selling all his shares in both companies.
(vi)  Show that Mr. Mohamed’s expectation of making a profit of 20% on his 
original investments through the dividends income and capital gains was 
not fulfilled.  
(i)  Number of shares bought in company A =  18x
 The annual dividends income from company A =  Rs 18x  2 =  9x
 Similarly,
  the annual dividends income from company  B  =  Rs 21( 96 000 – x)  3.50  
              
=  Rs 21( 96 000 – x) 27 
       
     
=  Rs 
6( 96 000 – x)  
    
            ...                         =  1000 is the required equation.
        6( 96 000 – x)–9x
  
18(ii)    6( 96 000 – x)–9x   =  1000
    18           =  18  1000
   6 ( 96 000 – x)–9x18 
           3 (96 000 – x ) – 2x  =  18 000
                  288 000 – 3x  – 2x =  18 000
   288 000 – 18 000  =  5x 
                                   270 000 =  5x
                                              x =  54 000
                               
... amount invested in company A is Rs 54 000.
         
         Amount invested in company B = Rs 96 000 – 54 000 =  Rs 42 000
                                              
(iii) Number of shares owned in company  A  =  1854 000   =  3000
              
 Number of shares owned in company B  =  2142 000   =  2000
              
(iv)  Income received from investment in company A = Rs 3000  2 =  Rs 6000
                             
     Income received from investment in company B = Rs 2000  3.50 = Rs  7000
                            
(v) Amount received by selling shares in company  A  =  Rs 3000  20 =  60 000
                       
 Amount received by selling shares in company  B  =  Rs 2000  20 =  40 000
                                  
... total amount received by selling the shares    =  Rs  60 000 + 40 000  
 in both the  companies
=  Rs 100 000
      The annual dividends income received from both  =  Rs  6000 + 7000
         companies 
=  Rs  13 000
...the sum of the amounts received as dividends 
 income and by selling the shares                       
    =   Rs  100 000 + 13 000  
 
       
 
                      
     =  Rs 113 000 
19Amount invested to buy shares in the   =  Rs  96 000
two companies  
 Profit  =  Rs  113 000 – 96 000

of the amount invested

Since 17.7% < 20%, Mr. Mohamed’s expectations were not fulfilled.

2211.1 The Midpoint Theorem
The midpoint theorem is a result related to the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
Let P be the midpoint of the side AB, and Q be the midpoint of the side  AC of the 
triangle ABC.  
   A
B CQ P
Then, 
AP = PB  and AQ = QC. 
This can also be written as  AP = PB = 1
2 AB  and  AQ = QC = 1
2 AC.
PQ is the line segment obtained by joining the midpoints of the sides  AB and AC.
Theorem
The straight line segment through the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is 
parallel to the third side and equal in length to half of it.
 
In relation to the above figure, according to the theorem,
 PQ// BC and
 PQ = 1
2 BC.          The Midpoint Theorem 11
By studying this lesson you will be able to
   • understand the midpoint theorem and its converse,
  • perform calculations and prove riders using the midpoint theorem and its 
converse.
23Let us do the following activity to establish this theorem.
Activity 1 
Construct the triangle  ABC such that AB =  6 cm,  BC = 7 cm and  CA = 8 cm. Name 
the midpoints of  AB and AC as P and Q respectively. Join PQ 
  (i) Measure the length of PQ and establish the fact that it is half the length of BC.
 (ii) Check using a set square or by some other method that PQ is parallel to BC.
By doing the above activity, you would have seen that PQ = 1
2 BC and PQ//BC. 
Let us consider through an example how the lengths of the sides of rectilinear plane 
figures related to triangles are found using the midpoint theorem.
Example 1 
    A
B CY X
An equilateral triangle ABC  of side length 12 cm is represented in the above          
figure.The midpoints of AB and AC are X and Y respectively.
Determine the following.
  (i) The length of XY.
 (ii) The perimeter of the quadrilateral BCYX .
  (i) According to the midpoint theorem,
      XY//BC  and XY = 1
2 BC. 
 ...  XY = 1
2  12
 = 6
   ... the length of  XY is 6 cm.
 (ii)  The perimeter of BCYX = BC + CY + XY + XB
                                = 12 + 6 + 6 + 6
                                = 30
     ... the perimeter of  BCYX is 30 cm.

respectively. 
To be proved:

    PQ = 1
2 BC.
Construction:  Draw a straight line through C parallel to BP such that it meets PQ 
produced at R. 
Proof:     
 In the two triangles  APQ and QCR,
AQ = QC  (since  Q is the midpoint of AC)
APQ = QRC 
>
> (since AP//RC, alternate angles)
                  AQP = RQC 
>
>  (vertically opposite angles)
          ... APQ    QCR  (AAS)
           ...AP = RC  and PQ = QR (corresponding sides of congruent triangles)
    However, AP = PB 
          ...PB = RC 
 In the quadrilateral  BCRP , PB = RC  and PB//RC. 
            ...BCRP is a parallelogram.    
...PR = BC and PR//BC. 
  However,  PQ = QR. 
... PQ = 1

  ...PQ//BC and PQ = 1

27Now let us consider how riders are proved using the midpoint theorem.

ABC. Prove that  NCLM is a parallelogram .

According to the midpoint theorem, ML= 1
2 BC  
                    = NC  (since N is the midpoint of  BC)
    Further, ML//BC.   
Therefore, a pair of opposite sides of the quadrilateral NCLM , are equal and parallel. 
Therefore, NCLM  is a parallelogram.

2911.3 Converse of the Midpoint Theorem

another side, bisects the third side.

X is the midpoint of the side PQ of the triangle PQR  in the figure (that is, PX = XQ ). 
If XY//QR, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem, Y is the midpoint of 
PR. That is, PY = YR . 
Do the following activity to establish this theorem.
Activity 2 
• Construct the triangle PQR such that PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and RP = 7 cm.
• Mark the midpoint of the side PQ as X.
• Name the point at which the straight line through X parallel to QR meets the side 
PR as Y.
• Measure the lengths of PY and YR and write down the relationship between these 
two lengths.
• Similarly, if the straight line through X parallel to PR meets the side QR at Z, write 
down the relationship between the lengths of QZ and ZR.
You would have observed by doing the above activity that PY = YR  and QZ = ZR. 
This establishes the fact that the straight line through the midpoint of one side of a 
triangle and parallel to another side, bisects the third side.
Now let us consider some applications of the converse of the midpoint theorem.
Example 1

  ... ABD      ADC  (AAS)
(ii)     BD = DC  (corresponding sides of the congruent triangles ADB  and ADC )
   Since    BD = DC  and  AC // DE, by the converse of the midpoint theorem,
   BE = EA.

In the triangle  APS, AQ = QP  and QR//PS. 
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem, 
           AR = RS  1
In the triangle  BRC , BP = PC and BR//PS. 
Therefore, according to the converse of the midpoint theorem,

3612.1 Finding the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations 
graphically
You have learnt in previous grades how to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous 
equations using algebraic methods. We will now consider how the solution to a pair 
of simultaneous equations is found by representing the equations graphically .
Let us consider the following pair of simultaneous equations.
    y  – x = – 3
   y  + 3x = 5 
Let us first solve this pair of simultaneous equations algebraically .
       
    y – x = – 3 1   
  y + 3x =  5 2
2 – 1 gives us,  
(y + 3x) – (y – x) = 5 – (– 3)
     ...y + 3x – y + x = 5 + 3
             ... 4x = 8
               ... x = 2
By substituting x = 2 in 1 we obtain,
  y – x = – 3
          ...   y = – 3 + 2
  ... y = – 1
 ...the solution is               
 x = 2 and y = – 1.
                            
When these two equations are considered separately, they can be written as                                       
y = x  –  3 and y = – 3x + 5 by making y the subject. Let us first draw the graphs of 
these straight lines on the same coordinate plane. Two tables of values corresponding 
to these equations are given below.
    y = x – 3     y = – 3x + 5
x  1 2 3
y– 2– 10x 1 2 3

 y = – 3x + 5(2, – 1)The graphs of the straight lines 
drawn on the same coordinate 
plane using the above tables of 
values intersect each other at the 
point (2, – 1). When the x and y 
values corresponding to this 
point are substituted into the 
given pair of equations, it can be 
observed that the two sides of the 
equations are equal. That is, the 
coordinates x = 2 and y = – 1 of 
the intersection point of these 
graphs is the solution to the given 
pair of simultaneous equations.
This geometric solution to the pair of simultaneous equations is further established 
by the fact that the same solution was obtained algebraically too.
Accordingly, to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically, 
the straight lines corresponding to the pair of equations should be drawn on the 
same coordinate plane, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the graphs 
should be found. Then the x and y values of the solution are obtained from the                      
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate respectively of the point of intersection.
In the following example, the method of constructing a pair of simultaneous 
equations and solving it graphically is considered.
 Example 1
A person buys 10 stamps, some of value Rs 10 and the rest of value Rs 20. The total 
value of the stamps is Rs 120.
 (i) By taking the number of stamps of value Rs 10 that he bought as x and the 
number of stamps of value Rs 20 as y, construct a pair of simultaneous 
equations.
 (ii) By solving the pair of simultaneous equations graphically, find the number of 
Rs 10 stamps and the number of Rs 20 stamps he bought.
The relevant pair of simultaneous equations is as follows.
         x  + y = 10 1   
 10 x + 20y = 120 2
38Let us represent each of the equations graphically.
  x + y  = 10; that is,  y = – x + 10   10x + 20 y = 120; that is, y = – 1
2 x + 6
x 2 46
y 8 64x 2 46

We obtain the following pair of straight lines.

x + y = 10 and 10 x + 20y = 120 are 
represented graphically, they 
intersect each other at the point                
(8, 2). Therefore, the solution to the 
pair of equations is  x = 8 and  y = 2. 
That is, the person bought eight           
Rs 10 stamps and two Rs 20 stamps.
Exercise 12.1

your answers by solving the equations algebraically too.

        – 2y = – x – 6   c.  3x – 4y = 7 
       5 x + 2y = 3
2.  A certain school has two Grade 11 classes A and B. If five students from class A 
move to class B, then the number of students in class B will be twice the number 
of students in class A. However, if five students from class B move to class A, 
then the number of students in the two classes will be equal. 
   (i)  Construct a pair of simultaneous equations by taking the number of students 
initially in class  A as x and the number of students initially in class  B as y.
    (ii) Draw the graphs of the pair of equations on the same coordinate plane and 
hence find the number of students in class A and in class B separately.

12.2 The graph of a function of the form  y = ax2 + bx + c   
Let us first consider how we can use the knowledge we have gained on the 
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form  y = ax2 + b to study the 
characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form  y = ax2 + bx + c.
Drawing graphs of functions of the form  y = ax2 + bx + c for a > 0  and 
identifying their characteristics
To identify some basic characteristics, let us first draw the graph of the function                       
y = x2 – 2x – 3. To do this, let us prepare a table as follows to obtain the values of y 
corresponding to the values of x for  – 2 < x < 4. 
x – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4
x2 4 1 0 1 4 9 16
– 2x 4 2 0 – 2 – 4 – 6 – 8
– 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3
y 5 0 – 3 – 4 – 3 0 5
(x, y)(– 2, 5) (– 1, 0) (0, – 3) (1, – 4) (2, – 3) (3, 0) (4, 5)
Before drawing the graph, it is important to consider the range of values that x and 
y take and prepare the coordinate plane accordingly. It is easy to draw the graph of  
y = x2 – 2x – 3 by taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 
small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale.

x   0  1  2

– 3

– 51 2 3 4 – 2  3  4  5  6
x = 1
The graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + bx + c  is called a parabola. 
We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.
•  The graph is symmetric about the line x = 1. Therefore, the equation of the axis 
of symmetry of the graph is x = 1.
As the value of x increases gradually from – 2, the corresponding y value decreases 
gradually until it attains its minimum value – 4 and then starts increasing again.
Let us describe the behaviour of y further for the given range of values of x.
•  As the value of x increases from  – 2 to – 1, the value of  y, that is, the value 
of the function decreases positively from 5 to 0. What is meant by “decreases 
positively” is that the function decreases while remaining positive.
•  The function takes the value 0 when  x = – 1.
•  As the value of x increases from – 1 to 1, the corresponding y value decreases 
negatively from 0 to  – 4.
• As the value of x increases from 1 to 3, the corresponding y value increases 
negatively from – 4 to 0 .
• The function takes the value 0 when  x = 3.
•  As the value of x increases from 3, the value of y increases positively.
By considering the above characteristics, the range of values of x for which the 
function is negative can be expressed in terms of inequalities as – 1 <  x  < 3.
42• The value of y is positive when the value of x is less than – 1 or greater than 3. 
That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is x <  – 1 and 
x > 3. 
Let us also pay attention to the following facts.
• It is very important to understand the relationship between the graph that has been 
drawn and the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.
This can be described as follows. 
 (1)  If any point ( a, b) lies on the graph, then the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3 is satisfied 
by x = a and y = b. That is the equation b = a2 – 2a – 3 is true.
 (2)  Conversely, if x = a and y = b satisfies the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3, then the 
point ( a, b) lies on the graph of the function y = x2 – 2x – 3.
It is extremely important to keep the above two facts in mind. Clearly the point            
(– 1, 0) lies on the graph.  Therefore, x = – 1 and y = 0 should satisfy the equation          
y = x2 – 2x – 3. That is, 0 = ( – 1)2 – 2 ( – 1) – 3. This can be verified by simplifying 
the right hand side. Another way of stating this is that x = – 1 is a root of the 
equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0.  By the same argument it can be stated that x = 3 is also 
a root of this equation. That is, the roots of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 are the x 
coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 intersects the x- axis. 
This can be written more generally as follows. 
The x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c  intersects the 
x - axis are the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c  = 0.
• The minimum value of the function is obtained at the turning point of the graph.  
The minimum value is – 4. The coordinates of the minimum point are (1,– 4).
     Drawing the graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a < 0 
and identifying their  characteristics
Let us prepare a table as follows for  – 4 < x < 2 to draw the graph of the function 
y = – x2 – 2x + 6.
x – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2
– x2 – 16 – 9 – 4 – 1 0 – 1 – 4
– 2x    8 6 4  2 0 – 2 – 4
+ 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6
y – 2 3 6 7 6 3 – 2
(x, y)(– 4, – 2) (– 3, 3) (– 2,  6) (– 1,  7) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, – 2)
43By considering the range of values of  x and y, and selecting 10 small divisions 
along the  x-axis to be one unit and 10 small division along the y axis to be two units 
as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows. 
x   0  1  2
– 1
– 2
– 31 2 3 4 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4  3  4  5  6  7y
We can identify the following characteristics by considering the graph.
• The graph which has a maximum value 7 is symmetric about the line x = – 1. 
• Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph is  x = – 1.
• The coordinates of the turning point are ( – 1, 7).
• As the value of x increases from – 4 to – 3.6, the value of y increases negatively. 
• The function takes the value 0 when x = – 3.6.
• As the value of x increases from – 3.6 to – 1, the corresponding y value increases 
positively from 0 to 7.
• The function attains its maximum value of + 7 when the value of  x is – 1.
• As the value of x increases from – 1 to + 1.6, the value of the function decreases 
positively.
• The function takes the value 0 when x = + 1.6.
• As the value of x increases from + 1.6, the value of y decreases negatively.
• When the value of x lies between – 3.6 and + 1.6, the value of the function is 
positive. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is           
– 3.6 < x < + 1.6.
• When the value of x is less than – 3.6 or greater than + 1.6, the function is negative.
• That is, the range of values of x for which the function is negative is x < – 3.6 and 
x > + 1.6.
44• The graph intersects the line y = 0 ( x-axis) when x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6. Therefore, 
the values of x which satisfy the equation – x2 – 2x + 6 = 0, that is, the roots of this 
equation are x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6.
• The maximum and minimum values that the function takes when 0 ≤ x ≤  2 ,  a r e           
6 and – 2 respectively.

12.3 The graph of a function of the form y = + (x + b )2 + c.   
y = + (x + b )2 + c is also an equation of a quadratic function. Here the quadratic 
function has been expressed in the special form  y = + (x + b )2 + c. When it is 
written in this form, some of the characteristics of its graph can be inferred without 
drawing the graph. Several such characteristic are given in the following table.

y = – (x + b) 2 + cMaximum c (– b, c) x = – b ( 0, – b2 + c)
46To verify the characteristics in the above table, let us consider the following example.
Let us consider the function y = (x + 1)2 – 2. This is of the form y = (x + b)2  + c 
where b = 1 and c = – 2. To draw the graph of this function for the values of x from 
– 4 to + 2, let us calculate the necessary values of y as shown in the following table.
x – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2
(x + 1)2 9 4 1 0 1 4 9

(x, y) (– 4, 7) (– 3, 2) (– 2,  – 1) (– 1,  – 2) (0, – 1) (1, 2) (2, 7)
By taking 10 small divisions along the  x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions 
along the y-axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be 
drawn as follows. 
 x   0  1  2
– 1
– 1
– 21 2 3 – 2 – 3 – 4  3  4  5  6  7yx = – 1
Note: 
This graph has a minimum point. The minimum value of the function is  – 2 (= c). 
The coordinates of the minimum point are ( – 1,  – 2), that is, (  – b, c).  The axis of 
symmetry is x = – 1 (That is, x = – b).
When a quadratic function has been given in the form  x = + (x + b)2 – c, the graph 
can be sketched using the characteristics in the above table. The example given 
below explains how this is done.
47Example 1 
Sketch the graph of y = –  (x – 2)2  + 3. 
Since the coefficient of ( x – 2)2  is negative, the turning point of the graph is a 
maximum. The coordinates of this maximum point is  (2, 3). The axis of 
symmetry of the graph is  x = 2. Further, to find the point at which the graph 
intersects the y-axis, let us substitute x = 0 in y = –  ( x – 2)2  + 3. We then obtain                                                     
y = – (0 – 2)2  + 3 = – 1.  Accordingly, we can sketch the graph as follows.

12.4 Graphs of functions of the form y = + (x + a) (x + b) 
 
y = + (x + a ) (x + b ) is also an equation of a quadratic function. The function has 
been written in the special form y =  x + (x + a) (x + b ). As in the above case, when 
the function is given in this form, certain characteristics of the graph of the function 
can be inferred without sketching the graph. The following table provides several 
such characteristics.

To verify the characteristics in the above table let us consider the following example.
Let us consider  y = – (x  – 1) (x  – 4).  This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b) where 
a = – 1 and  b = – 4. To draw the graph of this function, let us prepare a table of                   
(x, y) values as follows.

Verify as in the example of section 12.3 that this graph has the characteristics given 
in the table.
When a quadratic function is given in the form y = + (x + a) (x + b), its graph can 
be sketched by considering the characteristics given in the table.
The following example describes how this is done.
Example 1 
Sketch the graph of y = – (x + 3) ( x – 1). 
This is of the form y = – ( x + a) (x + b), where a = 3 and  b = – 1 Since the coefficient 
of x2  is negative, the turning point is a maximum. The points at which the graph 
intersects the x-axis are ( – 3, 0) and (1, 0). The coordinates of the maximum point 
51are – a + b

The given function can be written as y = (x – 2) ( x + 7). 
  (i) The graph is a parabola with a minimum.

5813.1 Simultaneous equations with fractional coefficients
We have learnt before how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the 
unknowns have integers as coefficients. Now we will explore through an example, 
how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have fractions 
as coefficients.
Example  1
Kamal and Nimal have a certain amount of money. When you add 1
2 of the amount 
Kamal has to  1
3 of  the amount Nimal has to get Rs 20. If  1
4 th of what Kamal 
has is e qual to  1
6 th of what Nimal has, find the amounts Nimal and Kamal have 
separately.
Let us see how we can construct a pair of simultaneous equations to solve this 
problem.
Let us take the amount Kamal has as Rs x and the amount Nimal has as  Rs y. Then,  
when you add  1
2 of what Kamal has,  that is,  Rs  1
2  x  to 1
3 of what Nimal has, that 
is, 1
3 y, you get 1
2 x + 1
3 y.  Since this is equal to Rs 20 we  get
 1
2 x + 1
3 y = 20. 1 as one equation.
Similarly , since 1
4  th of what Kamal has is equal to  1
6 th of what Nimal has, we get
 1
4 x = 1
6 y  as the second equation, which can be written as 
        1
4 x – 1
6 y = 0 2 
When solving simultaneous equations involving fractions, it often helps to first clear 
the fractions and work with only integers. To clear the fractions we have to multiply 
each side of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators.
Therefore, equation 1 is multiplied by 6 which is the the least common multiple 
of the denominators  2, and 3 and equation 2 is multiplied by 12 which is the least 
common multiple of the denominators  6 and 4.
59    1  6; 6  1
2 x + 6  1
3 y = 6  20
       ∴  3x + 2y = 120 3
2  12; 12  1
4 x – 12  1
6 y = 12  0
            3 x – 2y = 0 4
Now instead of 1 and 2 we can solve the two equivalent equations 3 and 4
involving only integers.
3 + 4   (3x + 2y) + (3 x – 2y) = 120 + 0
           3 x + 2y + 3x – 2y = 120
                      6x
6 = 120
6
               x  = 20 
                   By substituting  x = 20 in  4
                     3  20 – 2y = 0
2y = 60
y = 30       
 ... The amount Kamal has  = Rs 20 
      The amount Nimal has = Rs 30
Note: In this problem, once we converted the fractions into integers, we solved for 
the unknown x by adding the equations. Alternatively we can make one unknown 
the subject of one equation and substitute in the other equation to obtain the solution. 
We will discuss one such example now.
Example  2  
Solve.
 1
6 a – 1
5 b   = – 2  1
 1
3 a + 1
4 b   = 9 2      
    
The following steps will demonstrate how to solve simultaneous equations by 
substitution.
60Let us make a the subject of equation 1.
   1
6 a – 1
5 b = – 2 
  1
6 a = – 2 + 1
5 b 
      a = – 12 + 6
5 b   (multiplying both sides by 6)  3
We will substitute the value of a in equation  2.
       1
3 a + 1
4 b = 9
            1
3 (– 12 + 6
5 b) + 1
4 b = 9
           – 4 + 2
5 b + 1
4 b = 9
We will simplify the fractions by taking 20 as the common denominator which is 
the least common multiple of 4 and 5.
          8
20b+ 5
20b = 9 + 4
        13
20b = 13
             b = 13  20
    13
             b = 20
          
Substituting b = 20 in equation 3 (here you can substitute the value of b in either 
equation to find a), we get
                                   a  = – 12 + 6
5 b
  a  = – 12 + 6
5   20
 a  = – 12 + 24
 a  = 12
Therefore the solution to the problem is a = 12 and b = 20.     
We can verify that the solution is correct by substituting a = 12 and b = 20  in the 
original equations.
Let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20  in the left side of equation 1.
61  1
6 a – 1
5 b = – 2  
Left hand side  = 1
6 a – 1
5 b 
  = 1
6  12 – 1
5  20 
 = 2 – 4
 = – 2
 ... LHS =  RHS
The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution. 
That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation  1
6 a – 1
5 b = – 2
Similarly,
let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation  2.  
        1
3 a + 1
4 b = 9
  Left hand side  = 1
3 a + 1
4 b 
= 1
3  12 + 1
4  20
= 4 + 5
= 9  
 ... LHS =  RHS
The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution. 
That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation   1
3 a + 1
4 b = 9.
Therefore we can conclude that we have the correct answer.

Let us take:
1
2 m + 2
3 n = 1 1
5
6 m + 1
3 n = 4 2  
62As in example 1 we can either convert the fractions into integers or we can  equate 
the fractional  coefficients of a variable to solve the problem.
Let us equate the coefficients of the unknown n. We can do this by multiplying 
equation 2 by 2
 2  2   10
6 m + 2
3 n = 8 3
3 – 1    (10
6 m + 2
3 n) – ( 1

3 n) = 8 – 1
            10
6 m + 2
3 n–  1
2 m – 2
3 n = 7
             10
6 m –  3
6 m  = 7
                          7
6 m = 7
                7 m = 7   6 
                   m = 6
Let us substitute m = 6 in 1 . 
   1
2 m + 2
3 n = 1
           1
2   6 + 2
3 n = 1  
         3 + 2
3 n = 1
               2
3 n = 1 – 3
    2
3 n = – 2
      2n = – 6
        n = – 3        
        
Therefore the answer is m = 6 and n = – 3.
As in the previous problem, we can verify that the solution is correct by substituting 
the answers in the original equations.
Let us substitute m = 6 and n = – 3 in the original equations.
63 5
6 m + 1
3 n = 4 2
Left hand side  = 5
6 m + 1
3 n 
       = 5
6   6 + 1
3  (– 3)  
       = 5 – 1
       = 4
         
∴   Left hand side = Right hand side  1
2 m + 2
3 n = 1 1
Left hand side  = 1
2 m + 2
3 n 
       = 1
2  6 + 2
3  (– 3) 
       = 3 – 2
       = 1
         
∴  Left hand side = Right hand side 
Therefore we have the correct answer, m = 6 and n = – 3.

6413.2  Solving quadratic equations by factoring
You have learnt how to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the 
form  ax2 + bx + c = 0
Let us review a few a such examples.
Example1 
          Find the roots of the quadratic equation  x2 – 5x + 6 = 0. 
             ( x – 2) (x – 3) = 0 (by factoring)
   Then either      x – 2 = 0 or x – 3 = 0.
 Therefore  x = 2 or  x = 3
 Therefore the roots of the  equation are  x = 2 and x = 3.
Example 2 
Find the roots of 2 x2 + 3x – 9 = 0 
                2x2 + 6x – 3x – 9 = 0
       2x (x + 3) – 3 (x + 3) = 0
        (2 x – 3) (x + 3) = 0 (by factoring)
          2x – 3 = 0 or x + 3 = 0 
           x  = 3
2  or  x = – 3
   ...  x = 11
2 and x = – 3 are the roots of the equation.
Let us look at a more complex example.
Example 3 
Find the roots of   3
2x – 1 – 2
3x + 2  = 1.
Here we cannot see the quadratic equation immediately. But when we clear the 
fractions, it can be set up as a quadratic equation. For this, we will consider the 
common denominator of the left hand side.(You can also do this by multiplying the 
whole equation by the least common multiple of  2 x – 1 and 3 x + 2) 
        3(3x + 2) – 2 (2x – 1)
 (2x – 1) (3x + 2) = 1 (writing the left hand side as a single fraction)
65         3(3x + 2) – 2 (2x – 1) = (2x – 1) (3x + 2) (cross multiplying)
                  9 x + 6 – 4 x + 2 = 6 x2 + 4x – 3x – 2 (expanding the factors)
                      6 x2 – 4x – 10 = 0  (simplifying)
                        3 x2 – 2x – 5 = 0 (dividing the whole equation by 2)
                3 x2 – 5x + 3x – 5 = 0
      x (3x – 5) + 1 (3x – 5) = 0
                   (3 x – 5) (x + 1) = 0
 ...3x – 5 = 0  or  x + 1 = 0
 ...  x = 5
3 or x = – 1
   ... x = 12
3 or x = – 1
  ... x = 12
3 and x = – 1 are the roots of this equation .
Now let us consider a problem that can be solved by means of a quadratic equation.
Example 4 
The product of two consecutive integers  is 12. Find the two numbers.
Let us see how we can set up a quadratic equation to solve this problem.
Of the two consecutive integers, let us take x to be  the smaller integer. Then the 
other integer is x + 1.
Therefore the consecutive integers can be written as x, (x + 1) .
Since the product of the two numbers is 12 we get,
   x  (x + 1) = 12 .
  ... x2 + x – 12 = 0
After factoring we get
       ( x – 3) (x + 4) = 0 . 
This is,  x – 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0.
 ...x = 3 and x = – 4 are the solutions of the above equation.
If we take  x = 3 then the consecutive number is  (x + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4 .
If we take  x = – 4 the consecutive number is  (x + 1) = – 4 + 1 = – 3.
Therefore there are two pairs of consecutive numbers whose product will be 12. 
They are  3, 4 and –  4, – 3.
We can  verify the answer by substituting  the two pairs of values in the quadratic 
equation   x2 + x – 12 = 0.  
66 If we substitute x = 3 on the left hand side of x2 + x – 12 = 0,
        LHS = x2 + x – 12
        = 32 + 3 – 12
        = 9 + 3 – 12
        = 12  – 12
        = 0
 ...  LHS = RHS
 If we substitute x = – 4 on the left hand side,
       LHS = x2 + x – 12
        = ( – 4)2 + (– 4) – 12
        = 16 – 4 – 12
        = 16  – 16
        = 0
...  LHS = RHS
Therefore the solutions of the equation  x2 + x – 12 = 0 are indeed 3 and  – 4. 
Example 5 
The area of a rectangular plot of land is 150 square metres. The length of the plot is 
5 metres more than the width. Let x be the width of the plot.
   (i) Write the length of the plot in terms of x.
  (ii) Set up a quadratic equation in x to represent the area of the plot x. 
 (iii)  Solve the equation to find the length and the width of the plot.
  (i) Length  = x + 5.
 (ii) The given data can be shown more clearly by aid of a drawing.
  x 150 m2
  x + 5
       Area = length   width
      = (x + 5)  x
    x (x + 5) = 150
 This is the required equation.
 (iii)  Let us solve the above equation.
   x (x + 5) = 150
       x2 + 5x – 150 = 0
  (x – 10) (x + 15) = 0
67  ...x – 10 = 0 or x + 15 = 0
  ...x = + 10 or x = – 15 
The roots of the quadratic equation are x = + 10 and x = – 15. 
But since a length cannot be negative, the only acceptable answer is  x = 10.
Therefore the width of the rectangular  plot  = 10 m
 The length of the  rectangular  plot  = 15 m 
We can verify the answer by substituting x =  1 0  i n  t h e  q u a d r a t i c  e q u a t i o n                                      
x2 + 5x – 150 = 0.  
       LHS  = x (x + 5)
        = 10 (10 + 5)
        = 10  15
        = 150
...LHS  = RHS

13.3 Solving a quadratic equation by completing the square
We have seen how to solve a quadratic equation by factorization. This method is 
useful only when the factorization is easy to do. Many quadratic expressions, such 
as  x2 + 3x + 5 = 0   and 2 x2 – 5x –1 = 0  cannot be factorized easily.To solve such 
quadratic equations  we have to use alternative methods.One such method is to 
arrange the quadratic as a perfect square. This is known as solving the quadratic 
equation by completing the square. 
Before we proceed, let us recall how we learnt  to write an expression of the form 
x2 + bx as a perfect square.
Activity 
Write the constant you should include to convert each of the following expressions 
into a perfect square and write it as a perfect square.
a. x2 + 6x + 9    = (x + 3)2  e. (x + ...)2  = x2 + 8x + ...
f. (x + ...)2   = x2 + 2ax + ...  
g. (x + b)2   = x2 + ...x + b2 
h. (x + m)2  = x2 + ...x + m2 b. x2 + 8x + ...   = ............
c. x2 – 14x + ... = ............
d. x2 + 3x + ...   = ............
69First we will complete the square of a quadratic equation which can also be solved 
by factoring.
Example 1 
Solve    x2 + 2x – 3 = 0  by completing the square.
   
First we will keep all terms containing x on one side and  move the constant to the 
right. Then we get
                 x2 + 2x – 3 = 0
                    x2 + 2x = 3
To write the left hand side as a perfect square, take half of the x-term coefficient 
and square it and add this value to both sides. That is, in this problem we have to 
add +1 to both sides.
     x2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1
       (x + 1)2 = 4
Take the square root of both sides.  We have  to allow for both positive and negative 
values.          x  + 1 =  +4 
                    x  + 1 = + 2
              x   = + 2 – 1
Then x = + 2 – 1  or x = – 2 – 1         
                     x = 1 or x = – 3
Therefore the solutions to the above equation are  x = 1 and x = – 3.
Now let us look at another example.
    
Example 2 
 Solve   x2 – 4x + 1 = 0  by completing the square. 
      x2 – 4x + 1 = 0
                     x2  – 4x   – 1
                           x2 – 4x + 4 = – 1 + 4   
                    ( x – 2)2  = 3
                         x – 2 = +3  ^taking the square root of both sides)
       x = 2 +3
         x = 2 + 3   or  x = 2 – 3.   
  Suppose it is given that 3  is approximately 1.73 
 Then  x = 2 + 1.73 or  x = 2 – 1.73 
          x = 3.73 or x = 0.27
70 Then the solutions of this equation are x = 3.73 and x = 0.27. 
Example 3 
Find the roots of  2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0 by completing the square. 
Here it is easy if we first divide all the terms by 2 to make the leading coefficient 
(coefficient of the x2 term) one.
 2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0
  x2 + 3x – 5
2 = 0   (now the leading coefficient is one)
       x2 + 3x = 5
2
       x2 + 3x + 3

2x +2

4 
       x + 3
2 = +19
2
       x =  + 19 – 3             
2or x = – 19 – 3             
 2 
Suppose 4.36 is given as an approximate value of 19 .
 Then      x = 4.36 – 3               
2  or  x = – 4.36 – 3             
2 
     x = 0.68 or  x = – 3.68
The roots of the equation are x = 0.68 and x = – 3.68 .

13.4 Solving quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula
An easy method of solving a quadratic equation of the form  ax2 + bx + c = 0 is by 
using the quadratic formula.  
The quadratic formula is derived by completing the square on a general quadratic 
equation  ax2 + bx + c = 0. 
Once  the quadratic formula is derived, it is no longer necessary to use the process 
of completing the square to solve "each" quadratic equation.
        ax2 + bx + c = 0
      ax2 + bx = – c
    ax2

and arranging the terms on the right hand

 = b2 – 4ac
4a2  simplifying the right hand side by using to a

      Then    x + b
2a = +b2 – 4ac
  4a2
                 x = – b
2a+b2 – 4ac
  4a2 
  
                                       x = +b2 – 4ac
 – b

                  denominator)(simplifying the right hand side by using a  
common denominator)
72Therefore 
to solve  a quadratic equation of the form  ax2 + bx + c = 0
   we can use the quadratic formula  +– b
 2ab2 – 4acx =  
We get two values (roots) for x due to the positive and negative signs.
Here a is the coefficient of x2 
b is the coefficient of  x and 
c is the constant term.
Example 1 
Solve 2 x2 + 7x + 3 = 0  by using the quadratic formula.
To solve the equation 2 x2 + 7x + 3 = 0, we can take a = 2, b = 7 and c = 3 and 
substitute these values in  the quadratic formula  x = +– b
 2ab2 – 4ac 
 
  
             x  =    – 7 + 72 – 4  2  3
2  2 
   =    – 7 +

    425
 =  – 7 +
    4 5
            x =  – 7 + 5             
4  or x = – 7 – 5             
4 
 x  = – 1
2 or x = – 3 
            x = – 1
2 and x = – 3  are the solutions of the above equation.substitute these values in the quadratic formula x =+– b
 2ab2 – 4ac
73Example 2 
Solve 4 x2 – 7x + 2 = 0   by using the quadratic formula, and find its roots
Take  17 = 4.12.
 4x2 – 7x + 2 = 0  
Substitute  a = 4, b = – 7, c = 2.  ^According to the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0&
  in x = +– b
 2ab2 – 4ac.
   = – (– 7) +(– 7)2 – 4  4  2

    849 – 32 
 
  = 7 +
    817  
   = 7 +
    84.12  (17 = 4.12 is given)  
           x = 7 + 4.12             
8  or x = 7 – 4.12             
8 
 x  = 11.12              
8  or x =  2.88              
8   
           x = 1.39 or x = 0.36
           x = 1.39 and  x = 0.36 are the roots of the equation.
74Example 3 
Solve  x2 + 2x – 1 = 0  by using the quadratic formula and find the roots accurate to 
the second  decimal place.
 (Take 2 = 1.414).

    22.828 
           x = – 2 + 2.828             
2  or x = – 2 – 2.828             
2  
   = 0.828              
2          x = – 4.828             
2   
           x = 0.414 or x = – 2.414
 The roots are x = 0.41 and x = – 2.41.

The figure illustrates the line segment AB. The point C lies on AB s u c h  t h a t                              
AC = 2 cm and CB = 3 cm. Point C divides AB into two line segments AC and CB.
Then, the ratio of AC to CB can be written using their lengths as follows.
    AC : CB = 2 : 3
           Similarly     AC : AB = 2 : 5  (since AB = 5cm)
       hence       CB : AC = 3 : 2  
                         CB : AB  = 3 : 5. 
                                   
The ratio of the lengths of line segments should be written in the order of the line 
segments relevant to that ratio.

By studying this lesson you will be able to
• understand the meaning of equiangular and similar figures,
• identify the theorem “A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, divides the 
other two sides proportionally”,
• identify the converse theorem “If a straight line divides two sides of a triangle 
proportionally then that line is parallel to the remaining side”,
• identify the theorem “Corresponding sides of equiangular triangles are  
proportional”,
• identify the converse theorem “If the corresponding sides of two triangles are 
proportional then those triangles are equiangular”.
77As shown in the figure, the points P, Q and R lie on each side of the triangle ABC . 
Then the ratios can be written as follows.  
  (i) AP : PB = 2 : 3,   AP : AB = 2 : 5, PB : AP = 3 : 2
 (ii) AQ : QC = 1 : 5,  AQ : AC = 1 : 6, QC : AQ = 5 : 1
(iii) BR : RC = 3 : 3 = 1 : 1, BR : BC = 3 : 6 = 1 : 2
We have already learnt that ratios can be written as fractions. 
Therefore AQ : QC = 1 : 5 can be also written as  AQ
QC = 1

14.1 Dividing two sides of a triangle by a line drawn parallel to

Let us do the following activity to find out about the ratios in which two sides of a 
triangle are divided by a line drawn parallel to the other side.
Activity
• Draw a triangle  ABC with AB = 6cm and choosing any length for the other two 
sides.
• Mark the points P and Q on AB such that AP = 2 cm and AQ = 3 cm.
• Using the set square or using any other method, draw a line through Q parallel to 
BC and name the point that it meets the line AC as R.

• Similarly check the relationship between the ratios in which the two sides of 
a right angled triangle and obtuse angled triangle are divided by a line drawn 
parallel to the other side.
Check whether your results agree with the following sentence.
A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in 
equal ratios.
The above result can be given as a theorem in geometry.
Theorem:
A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle divides the other two sides 
proportionally.
As an example, the line AB drawn parallel to the side PR of the triangle  PQR  is 
shown in the figure.
Then according to the theorem,

As shown in figure (i), the line PQ drawn parallel to BC internally divides the 
sides AB and AC. But in figure (ii) and figure (iii), the line PQ, drawn parallel to 
BC meets other two sides produced  at P and Q. In these kinds of situations, it is 
79said that PQ externally intersects AB and BC. Irrespective of whether the sides are 
divided internally or externally, the theorem is valid.
Hence for all three figures above,   AP
PB = AQ
QC '
Now consider the following examples with calculations using the theorem.
Example  1    
In triangle  PQR, the line XY is drawn parallel to  PR.  Find the length of  RY i f

Let x be the length of RY.
Then, since XY is drawn parallel to PR,
  according to the theorem    RY

8314.2 More on dividing two sides of a triangle proportionally
In this section let us consider how riders are proved using the theorem “A line 
drawn parallel to a side of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally”
Example  1    
In the given figure, PQRS and PA B are straight lines. BS//AR and BR//AQ.   
Prove that PQ : QR = PR : RS.

Proof:  In the triangle PBR, as AQ is parallel to BR, according to the theorem,
   PA : AB = PQ : QR  1
     In the triangle  PBS as AR is parallel to BS, according to the  theorem
   PA : AB = PR : RS  2
From 1 and 2 
  PQ : QR = PR : RS
Example  2    
The point D lies on the side BC of the triangle ABC . The line BE drawn parallel to 
AC meets AD produced at E. The line drawn from D, parallel to AB meets AC at P. 
Prove that CP : AP = AD : DE.

Here, as in the above example, choose two triangles and in each triangle draw a 
line parallel to a relevant side of the triangle. We choose triangles ABE and ABC , 
because there is a common side to these two triangles.
But there is no line parallel to a side of the ABC  triangle. Therefore let us construct 
such a line.
84Construction : Draw line DQ parallel to BE such that  it meets AB at Q. (Then AC, 
QD, and BE are parallel to each other)
Proof : 
 In the triangle ABC , PD is parallel to AB. Therefore by the theorem,    
   CP : P A = CD : DB  1
  In the triangle ABC, QD is parallel to  AC. Therefore by the theorem,  
   AQ : QB = CD : DB  2
 In the triangle  ABE, QD is parallel to  BE. Therefore by the theorem,  
   AQ : QB = AD : DE  3
From the equations  1" 2 and 3 
  CP : P A = CD : DB = AQ : QB = AD : DE.
 ... CP : P A = AD : DE

The above theorem says that, in triangle ABC , a line drawn parallel to BC divides 
AB and AC in equal ratios .
That is, since BC//DE , AD : DB = AE : EC. Let us understand the converse of this 
theorem by considering the triangle PQR shown in the figure.
    P
B A
Q R
Here the line  AB intersects the sides PQ and PR. The ratios of the line segments of 
each side are  PA : AQ and PB : BR.
If these two ratios are equal, that is, if PA : AQ = PB : BR then the line AB, which 
intersects those two sides at P and Q, is parallel to the other side QR. This is the 
converse of the theorem we have already learnt in this lesson. This result can be 
stated as a theorem.
The converse of the above theorem: 
If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then that line is 
parallel to the other side.                                                                 
Given below are some examples with calculations and proved riders related to the 
theorem.

Based on the information in the figure, find the value of AX : XF.
Consider the triangle  ABC. Then , AD : DB = 4 : 3 and
     AE : EC = 6 : 4.5 = 4 : 3.                  
                     ...    AD : DB =  AE : EC 
  ... The line  DE divides AB and AC proportionally.
  ... By the converse of the theorem, DE//BC .
Therefore in triangle ABF, since DX//BF ,
 AD : DB =  AX : XF
But AD : DB =  4 : 3 
Hence AX : XF  =  4 : 3

The point P lies on the side AB of the quadrilateral ABCD . The line drawn through 
P, parallel to AC, meets BC at Q. Similarly, the line drawn through P, parallel to 
AD, meets BD at R. Prove that RQ//DC .
87Proof : 
    In triangle  ABD, since  PR is parallel to the side  AD,
   BP : P A = BR : RD  1
  In triangle  ABC, since  PQ is parallel to the side  AC,
   BP : P A = BQ : QC  2
From equations  1 and 2 
  BR : RD = BQ : QC.
      
     ... In triangle BDC , the line RQ divides the sides BD and BC proportionally .
     ... RQ//DC  (by the converse theorem)
For the following exercises use the converse theorem given above.

14.4 Similar figures and equiangular figures
Carefully observe the following three triangles.
                   
In day to day language we say that these three triangles are of the "same shape".
The following figure illustrates three quadrilaterals and three pentagons of the same 
shape.
But the following pair of triangles as well as pair of quadrilaterals are not of the 
same shape.  
 
     
Did you think of what is meant by "shape" here? In mathematics things should be             
defined precisely. It is necessary to give a precise definition for —shape˜. —Similar 
figure˜ is the phrase in mathematics equivalent to —same shape ˜ in day to day 
language.  Here we consider only the similarity of polygons.
89Two polygons are said to be similar if; 
 1. the angles of one polygon are equal to the angles of the other and,
 2. the corresponding sides of the polygons are proportional. 
As an example, consider the following two quadrilaterals ABCD  and PQRS.
  APD
SC
R
BQ
In these two quadrilaterals,
    if A
>
 = P
>
, B
>
 = Q
>
, C
>
 = R
>
, D
>
 = S
>
and
 AB
PQ = BC
QR = CD
RS = DA
SP,  
then the quadrilaterals  ABCD  and PQRS are similar.
In this lesson we hope to study more about similar triangles. 
In the two triangles ABC  and PQR given below, 
if  A
>
 = P
>
, B
>
 = Q
>
, C
>
 = R
>
 
and  AB
PQ = BC
QR = CA
RP , then by definition the two triangles are similar.
 AC
BR
P Q
There is an important result related to the similarity of triangles. That is, if  the 
angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of another triangle, then those two 
triangles are similar. In otherwords, if three angles of a triangle are equal to the three 
angles of another triangle then the corresponding sides of  those two triangles are 
proportional. Therefore to find out whether two triangles are similar, it is sufficient 
to check only the angles of the two triangles. As an example, in the above two 
triangles, if  A
>
 = P
>
, B
>
 = Q
>
 and  C
>
 = R
>, then  AB
PQ = BC
QR = CA
RP '
90This result is not true for polygons which are not triangles. For example, in  the 
following two quadrilaterals, the angles of one quadrilateral are equal to the 
angles of the other quadrilateral. Each of these angles is 90x. However one of the 
quadrilaterals is a rectangle and the other is a square. Therefore their sides are not 
proportional and hence the two quadrilaterals are not similar.
  
If the angles of two polygons are equal, then those polygons are said to be equiangular. 
According to the above discussion, two equiangular triangles are similar too. Let us 
use this result as a theorem without proof.
Theorem on equiangular triangles:
If two triangles are equiangular then the corresponding sides are 
proportional.
Do the following activity to understand more about this result.
Activity
² Using the protractor, draw two different sized triangles, each with interior angles  
40x, 50x and 90x . As shown below, name the  triangles as ABC and PQR .
 
40x
A BC
50x40xP QR
50x
²  Find the ratios(as fractions) between the corresponding sides of the two triangles.
   That is, find the values of  AB
PQ, BC
QR and  CA
RP  separately.
² Check whether these three values are equal.(You can have minor errors because 
of errors in the measurements)
According to the above activity, you can understand that if two triangles are 
equiangular  then they are similar.
91Note :
1.If restricted to triangles, similar and equi-angular mean the same thing. 
2.It is clear that two congruent triangles are similar. But two similar triangles may  
   not be congruent.
3. If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then 
the remaining pair of angles are also equal to each other. The reason for this is 
because the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180x. Therefore, if 
two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then they 
are equiangular.

Next we investigate the converse of the above theorem. That is, to find whether 
the statement "if the sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are 
equiangular" is true .This converse is true and we can state this result as a theorem.
Also, if the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides of another 
triangle then the two triangles are said to be similar.
Do the following  activity to understand this result further.
Activity

² Observe the relationship between the values  AB

² Measure the angles of each triangles separately.
² What type of triangles are ABC  and PQR ?
 
Through this activity you may have observed that the corresponding sides of the 
two triangles are proportional and also that the angles of ABC  are equal to the 
angles of PQR .
This result can be expressed as the converse theorem of the theorem which we 
learnt about equiangular triangles earlier.
Theorem: If the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides 
of another triangle, then the two triangles are equiangular.

100Limits and boundaries of class intervals
The following is data of the heights (to the nearest centimetre) of 30 students
 137, 135, 141, 147, 151, 135, 137, 143, 144, 145
 140, 134, 141, 140, 153, 144, 133, 138, 155, 130
 136, 137, 142, 143, 145, 143, 154, 146, 148, 158
We know that the range is the value which is obtained by subtracting the least value 
of the data from the highest value of the data. Therefore,
               The range of the data  = 158 – 130
      = 28
To facilitate interpretation, a group of data is often represented as a frequency 
distribution. We know that if the range of the data is large, then the data is divided 
into class intervals. Such a frequency distribution is called a grouped frequency 
distrbution . In such frequency distributions, generally, the number of class intervals 
should be between 5 and 10. The size of a class interval is determined by dividing 
the range of the frequency distribution by the number of class intervals and taking 
the least integer greater than that value .  
For example let us group the above data into 6 class intervals. To find the size of a 
class interval, first divide 28 (the range) by 6 (number of class intervals).
   then, we obtain  28
 6   4.66 '
Hence the size of each interval should be 5, which is the least integer greater than 
4.66.Data Representation and 
Interpretation 15
By studying this lesson, you will be able to
 ²  find the limits and boundaries of the intervals of a frequency distribution
 ²  draw the relevant histogram
 ²  draw the relevant frequency polygon
 ²  draw the relevant cumulative frequency curve and find the inter quartile 
range from  that curve
101Next the first class interval needs to be selected. Since the lowest value of the data 
is 130, the first class interval should start from 130. 
The following are two different grouped frequency distributions from the given 
data.
    Class intervals Frequency
130 -135 3
135 - 140 7
140 - 145 10
145 - 150 5
150 - 155 3
155 - 160 2

140 - 144 10
145 - 149 5
150 - 154 3
155 - 159 2
  Second grouped distribution
Consider the first grouped distribution.  As an example, the 130 - 135  class interval 
represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than 135.  The second 
class interval 135 - 140 represents the heights greater than or equal to 135 and less 
than 140. The other class intervals can be described similarly.  
Now consider the second grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 134  class 
interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal 
to 134.
Let us observe another difference between these two distributions. In the first 
distribution there are no gaps between the class intervals. For example, the class 
interval 135 - 140 starts from the upper limit 135 of the previous class interval                            
130 - 135. So there is a common limit for these class intervals. But this is not so 
in the second distribution. For example 134 is the upper limit of the class interval 
130-134, but the next class interval starts from 135. The gap between  these two 
limits is 1.
In the next section of this lesson we hope to learn how to draw histograms. To draw 
a histogram, there should not be these kinds of gaps. Therefore we must change 
the second distribution appropriately. This change can be done by introducing  a 
common boundary for the class intervals. That common boundary can be determined 
easily. 
For example, in the second distribution, 134.5 is taken as the boundary of the class 
intervals 130 - 134 and 135 - 139, which is the exact middle of the upper limit    
(134) of the class interval 130 - 134 and the lower limit (135) of the class interval 
135 - 139.The new distribution constructed in this way is given below.       
102       
        
Class intervals with boundaries Frequency
129.5 - 134.5 3
134.5 - 139.5 7
139.5 - 144.5 10
144.5 - 149.5 5
149.5 - 154.5 3
154.5 - 159.5 2
Here observe that, 0.5 is subtracted from the lower limits and 0.5 is added to the 
upper limits of every class interval of the original distribution.This rule is valid for 
the first and last class intervals too. The values 129.5 and 159.5 are obtained in that 
way. Also observe that, the size of the class interval of this new distribution is 5.
In the above, the first kind of distribution is simple. But practically, the second kind 
of distribution can be constructed easily. Both kinds of distributions can be found 
in statistics.
         15.1 Histogram of a grouped frequency distribution
Let us consider how to draw the histogram of a grouped frequency distribution. A 
histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution. In a 
histogram, the frequencies of class intervals are represented by the  heights of the 
rectangular columns which touch each other. Let us consider first, how to draw 
the histogram if the sizes of the class intervals are equal.(As in the example in the 
previous section).
When drawing the histogram, follow the steps given below.
² Mark the boundaries of the calss intervals on the horizontal axis drawn to an 
appropriate scale.       
² Along the vertical axis, on an appropriate scale, draw the columns such that the 
height of the column on a class interval is the corresponding frequency.
By considering the following example, let us observe how to draw the histogram.
Example 1
 
Draw the histogram of the grouped frequency distribution prepared in the previous 
section.
103For this, let us consider the second frequency distribution.

Observe here that the columns touch each other.
Note: Since the data starts from 129.5, it is not necessary to show the class 
intervals from 0 to 129.5 in the histogram. The mark at the beginning of the x 
axis indicates that the axis has been shrunk in this region.
Example 2
The following is a frequency distribution of the Mathematics marks of students 
taken from a School Based Assessment.

As an example, the interval 0 - 10 represents the marks greater than or equal to 0 
and less than 10. The other class intervals are defined similarly. Draw the histogram 
of the frequency distribution.
In this frequency distribution, the first class interval ends at 10 and next class 
interval starts at 10.This histogram can be drawn easily.

Now let us consider how to draw a histogram of a frequency distribution with 
different sized class intervals.
Example 3
A frequency distribution based on the marks of 40 students in a term test is given 
below.
Class intervals
(Marks Obtained)0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 70 70 - 100
Frequency
(Number of students)2 4 6 9 5 8 6
If you observe the class intervals, you can see that the sizes of the class intervals 
are not the same. The size of each of the first 5 class intervals is 10 and the sizes of 
the next two class intervals are 20 and 30 respectively. Another important feature 
in a histogram  is that the areas of the columns are proportional to the relevant 
frequencies. 
105Therefore if the sizes of the class intervals are equal, then the frequencies are 
proportional to the heights of the columns. Hence in the above examples 1 and 
2, the frequency can be identified directly with the height of the column. But in 
this example, since the sizes of the class intervals are not the same, the frequency 
cannot be identified directly with the height of the column. The heights of the 
columns should be obtained such that the areas of the columns are proportional to 
the frequences. This can be done as follows.
In this frequency distribution, the size of all but the class intervals 50 - 70 and               
70 - 100 is 10. The size of the class interval 50 - 70 is 20 and the size of the class 
interval 70 - 100 is 30.
Hence the size of the smallest class interval is 10 and the size of the class interval       
50 - 70 is two times that. Since the area of the column which represents the frequency 
of the class interval should be proportional to the frequency,
     Height of the column =  frequency 
2 
  ... The height the column of the 50 - 70 class interval   = 8
2  
                      =  4
The size of the class interval 70 - 100 is three times the size of the smallest class 
interval.
...  The height the column of the 70 - 100 class interval  = 6
3  
                      = 2 
After these calculations, the histogram can be drawn as follows.

15.2 Frequency polygon
A frequency polygon is a graphical representation of grouped data similar to a 
histogram. There are two methods to construct frequency polygons.
  ²   From the histogram of the frequency distribution
  ²   From the mid-values and frequencies of the class intervals 
In the following example, let us consider first, how to construct a frequency polygon 
from the histogram.
Example 1
Let us consider a frequency distribution used in a previous example.

 (ii) In each column in the histogram, mark the sign —˜ at the middle of the top of 
the column. (See the following figure; the signs —˜  denoted as  A, B, C, D and 
E ) 
108(iii) Join these —˜signs by the line segments as shown in the figure.
(iv) On the horizontal axis, mark half the length of  the class interval to the right of 
the last class interval and to the left of the first class interval (hence 5 units) ' 
Join E F and  A G.

Now you get the polygon  ABCDEFG.  This polygon is called the frequency polygon 
of the frequency distribution. If you observe carefully, you can see that the area 
of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of the columns of the 
histogram.  
To draw a frequency polygon, it is not necessary to draw the histogram first. The 
frequency polygon can be drawn directly by using the mid-values of the class 
intervals and using the relevant frequencies. The following example shows how to 
draw the frequency polygon using this method. 
Example 2
From the given frequency distribution, prepare a table with the mid-values of the 
class intervals to draw the frequency polygon.

Mark the mid-values of the class intervals along the horizontal axis and mark 
the frequencies along the vertical axis. Then mark the corresponding points. The

segments.

Here, the class interval 50 - 60 of size 20 is divided in to two class intervals of 
size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class 
interval is considered. Similarly the class interval 70 - 100 of size 30 is divided in 
110to three class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of 
the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Also in this case, observe that 
the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of columns of the 
histogram.

   (ii) Use this histogram to draw the frequency polygon.
15.3 Cumulative frequency curve of a grouped frequency 
        distribution
This is a another method of representing data of a frequency distribution
graphically.   
    
Let us see how to draw the cumulative frequency curve by considering the following 
example
Example  1 
The following is a frequency distribution of the marks in Mathematics of 32 students 
in a class. Let us draw its cumulative frequency curve. 
Marks 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50
Number of students 4 6 10 9 3
Let us construct a cumulative frequency table from the above table.
112Class intervals Frequency Cumulative

The word "cumulative" means "increasing by addition". For example, in the above 
table, the cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 20-30 is the sum of 
all frequencies less than in the intervals up to the class mark 30. (In other words 
no. of students whose marks are less than 30) That is equal to 20. The cumulative 
frequency relevant to the class interval 40 - 50 is the number of students whose 
marks are less than 50. That is 32, the total number of students. After completing 
this table, to draw the cumulative frequency curve, all the points corresponding to 
the upper limit of each class interval via the relevant cumulative frequency should 
be marked. These points should be joined smoothly, as shown below.

15.4  Quartiles and interquartile range of a frequency distribution
In previous sections, we learnt how to construct a histogram, frequency polygon 
and cumulative frequency curve from a group of data. These are useful to get an 
idea about how far the data disperses centrally. For example, just by looking at the 
histogram, the modal class of a grouped frequency distribution can be decided. 
Similarly, an idea on how far the data disperses symmetrically can also be obtained. 
In this section, we hope to learn about quartiles and the interquartile range of a 
group of data. From this we can get some idea about the dispersion of data.
113The first thing to do to find quartiles and the interquartile range is to organize the 
data in ascending order. After that the first quartile  (Q1), the second quartile  (Q2) 
and the third quartile  (Q3) can be found as follows.
Step 1: First find the median of the data. This is the second quartile.
Step 2: Find the median of the data to the left of the second quartile. This is the 
first  quartile.
Step 3: Find the median of the data to the right of the second quartile. This is the 
third quartile.
As an example, consider the following group of data which is in ascending order.
Example  1
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
Here,there are 19 data. The median of these is 14 (It is in the square)
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
Now consider the data left of the median.
5, 6, 6, 8, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13
The median of that part is 11. That is also in the square.
At last, consider the data right of the median. '
14, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 30
The median of that part is 20. That is also in a square.
Hence,
first quartile  = Q1 = 11
second quartile  = Q2= 14
third quartile  = Q3= 20.
114Example  2
Let us find the quartiles of the following 18 data written in ascending order .
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20 
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20
Its median is the mean of the 8 and 11 in the rectangle.
Hence,
 Q2 = 
   8 + 119.52=
The left side of the median is:
2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8
The median of that is 6. It is in the square.
Hence Q1=  6.
At last, the right side of the median is:  
11, 11, 12, 12, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20
The median of that is 15. It is in the square.
Hence Q3=  15.
Example  3
There are 17 data in the following data string. Find the quartiles.
102, 104, 104, 105, 107, 107, 107, 108, 112, 112, 113, 115, 115, 119, 120, 125, 126
The heads of the arrows indicate the quartiles which are calculate according to the 
above steps.
102, 104, 104, 105, 107, 107, 107, 108, 112, 112, 113, 115, 115, 119, 120, 125, 126
115 Q1 =
  105 + 1071062=
Q2 = 112
 Q3=
  115 + 1191172=
Example  4
There are 16 data in the following data string. Observe how to calculate the quartiles 
which are indicated by the heads of arrows.
21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 28, 28, 30, 30, 34, 34, 35, 37, 37, 40, 42
Hence ,  Q1=    25 + 2625.5,2=
  Q2=    30 + 3030,2=
 Q3=    35 + 3736.2=
In statistics, there are several methods to find quartiles of a data string. The method 
described here is the most practical and the most convenient method.
Another method to calculate quartiles is, finding the locations of the quartiles using 
the formulae
Q1 in the 1
4 (n + 1) position, Q2 in the 2
4 (n + 1) position, Q3 in the 3
4 (n + 1) position.
For example, consider the data string  4  6  7  8  15  18  20.
In this data string, according to the formulae, 
Q1 is located at the place  1(7 + 1)4 = 2. Hence  Q1 = 6.
Q2  is located at the place  2(7 + 1)4 = 4'  Hence  Q2 = 8.
Q3 is located at the place  3(7 + 1)4 = 6'  Hence   Q3 = 18.
As another example, consider the data string  9  12  18  20  21  23  24  26.
In this data string, according to the formulae,   105 + 1071062=
    
   
  115 + 1191172=
116Q1 is located at the place  1(8 + 1)4 = 2. 25.  Hence Q1 = 12 +  1
4 (18 – 12) = 13.5
Q2 is located at the place  2(8 + 1)4 = 4.5. Hence Q2 =  20 + 2120.52=
Q3 is located at the place   3(8 + 1)4 = 6.75. Hence Q3 = 23 +  3
4 (24 – 23) = 23.75
Here, when using different methods from each other, different answers with small 
deviations may be obtained. But this is not a problem since in methods of statistics 
it is expected to get approximate values.
The interquartile range of a group of data is the value obtained by subtracting the 
first quartile from the third quartile.
Hence              Interquartile range  =  Q3 –  Q1

 More on Interquartile Range
In this section, we hope to learn how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of 
grouped data. Here we describe only, how to find it using the cumulative frequency 
curve. Let us consider how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped 
data from the following example.
Example  1
The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the Mathematics marks of 
a group of students in grade 11. Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve for this 
frequency distribution.
Marks 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 60 60 - 70 70 - 80
No. of students 4 5 7 8 10 9 5 4
Let us construct a table from this data to draw the cumulative frequency curve.
Class intervals Frequency Cumulative frequency

30
Now let us pay attention to the vertical lines and the horizontal lines in the above 
figure of the cumulative frequency curve.
Here the total number of data is 52. That is, the sum of the frequencies is 52. Let 
us first find, the locations of the first, second and third quartiles of those 52 data.  
Note: When finding the quartiles from the cumulative frequency curve, there is 
no need to do it as in setion 15.5. Since the number of data is large (More than 30 
data values is considered as a large number of data), it is sufficient to locate the 
positions of  1
4 of the frequencies,  1
2 of the frequencies  and  3
4 of the frequencies. 
When the cumulative frequency is increasing then the first quartile is located at the 
position of  1
4 th of the total frequency. Hence,  
the position of Q1  =     1
4×52   th position  = 13th position
the position of Q2  =     1
2×52th position  = 26th position
the position of Q3  =     3
4×52th position  = 39th position
Now it is needed to find the data corresponding to the points 13, 26 and 39 
(frequencies)
119of the vertical axis. The necessary lines are illustrated in the figure. As an example 
the first quartile can be found as follows.
Since the first quartile is located at the 13th position, a horizontal line is drawn from 
the point 13 on the vertical axis until it meets the curve. From the point that line 
meets the curve, a vertical line is drawn until it meets the horizontal axis. The value 
of that point on the horizontal axis is the first quartile.  
If we find the quartiles for the given example, then we get  Q1 = 26,  Q2 = 42 and                
Q3 = 55'
Hence, the interquartile range  = Q3 – Q1 = 55 – 26 = 29.
As an example, if the total frequency of a frequency distribution is 51 then the first, 
the second and the third quartiles are  in the
    1
4×51 = 12.75th position
    1
2×51 = 25.5th position
    3
4×51 = 38.25th position respectively.
Hence the quartiles can be found by considering the values on the x-axis  
corresponding to the values 12.75, 25.5 and 38.25 (or the appropriate values 
rounded to the scale of the graph) on the vertical axis.

12216.1  Geometric Progressions
Let us first recall what we learnt in grade 10 about arithmetic progressions. Given 
below is an arithmetic progression.
 5, 7, 9, 11, ...
In this sequence, by adding the constant value 2 to any term, the term next to it is 
obtained. We called this constant value the common difference of the arithmetic 
progression. 
Now, careful observe the sequence given below. 
 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ...
In this sequence, the first term is 3. The second term is obtained by multiplying 
the first term by 2, third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 2. The 
sequence continues in this manner, where, each term multiplied by 2 is the next 
term. In other words, if we divide any term other than the first term, by the previous 
term  we get the constant value 2.
A sequence that yields a fixed value when any term, other than the first term, is 
divided by the previous term is called a geometric progression . The fixed value, by 
which each term is multiplied to obtain the next term, is called the common ratio  of 
the geometric progression. The common ratio of the above geometric progression 
is 2.
Given a number sequence, one can check whether it is a geometric progression by 
doing the following test. Note down the value obtained by dividing the second term 
by the first term. Similarly, note down the values obtained by dividing the third 
term by the second term, fourth term by the third term and so forth. If the values 
noted down are all equal, then it is a geometric progression. When the noted values 
are all equal, this common value is the  common ratio .                     Geometric progressions 16
By studying this lesson you will be able to,
 ²  identify whether a given number sequence  is a geometric progression,
 ²   use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression,
 ²   use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression
   and
²  solve problems related to geometric progressions.
123Example  1 
Check whether the number sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression.  
  6
2 = 3,   18
6 = 3,       54
18 = 3
   ...   6
2 = 18
6 = 54
18 = 3
 ...The given sequence is a geometric progression. Moreover, the common                       
ratio is 3. 
Example  2
Check whether the number sequence  200, 100, 50, 20, ...  is a geometric progression.
  100
200 = 1
2,    50
100 = 1
2,           20
50 = 2
5
Because the ratios are not equal, this sequence is not a geometric progression. 
Example  3
Check whether the number sequence  5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80, ... is a geometric 
progression.
  –10
  5 = – 2,    20
–10 = – 2,       – 40
20 = – 2,        80
– 40 = – 2
     ...  –10
  5 =  20
–10 = – 40
20 =   80
– 40 = – 2
 ... This is a geometric progression with common ratio  – 2. 
Example  4
The terms 4,  x,  16 are consecutive terms of a geometric progression. What is the 
value of x? 
x
4 = 16
x because the terms are in a geometric progression. We can find the value of 
x by solving this equation.
124If  x
4 = 16
x, then x2 = 64.
Thus       x2 – 82 = 0
... (x – 8) (x + 8) = 0
... x = 8 or x = – 8
Let us check for each of the values we have obtained, whether the three terms 4, x, 
16 are in a geometric progression.  
When x = 8" the sequence  4, 8, 16 is a geometric progression with common ratio 2.  
When x = – 8" the sequence  4, – 8, 16 is a geometric progression with a common 
ratio  – 2. 
Exercise 16.1

16.2  n th term of a Geometric Progression
Recall that you learnt, in Grade 10, that the nth term of an arithmetic progression 
with first term a and common difference d is  Tn  = a + (n – 1) d. 
Let us now consider how we can obtain an expression for the nth term of a geometric 
progression. We will write —a˜ for the first term of the geometric progression and  
—r˜ for the common ratio. Moreover, we will denote the nth term of the sequence 
by  Tn .
Consider the geometric progression  2, 6, 18, 54, ... . Here, the first term ( a)  is 2  
and  the common ratio ( r) is 3'
Carefully observe that; 
 T1 = 2 = 2  1 = 2  31 – 1
 T2 = 6 = 2  3 = 2  32 – 1
 T3 = 18 = 2  3  3 = 2  33 – 1
 T4 = 54 = 2  3  3  3 = 2  34 – 1
The above expressions can be written in terms of the first term  (a) and the common 
ratio  (r), as
125 T1 = 2  30 = a  r1 – 1
 T2 = 2  31 = a  r2 – 1
 T3 = 2  32 = a  r3 – 1
 T4 = 2  33 = a  r4 – 1       
According to the observable pattern, the nth term Tn can be written as  Tn  = arn – 1'
The nth term of the geometric progression with first term  a and common 
ratio  r  is given by
Tn  = arn – 1 '
Example  1
Find the 5th term of the geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2.
  a = 3,  r = 2, n = 5
Tn  = arn – 1
T5   = 3  25 – 1
 
   = 3  24
  
  = 3  16
    = 48
Therefore, the 5th term is   48'
Example  2
Find the fifth and the seventh terms of the geometric progression 81, 27, 9,...
 a = 81                                      T7   = 81  1
37 – 1
      = 81  1
36
      = 81    1
729 
      = 1
9  r = 27
81 = 1
3 
    Tn = arn – 1   
         ...    T5   = 81  1
35 – 1 
  
              = 81  1
34   
              
= 81    1
81              = 1
Thus, the fifth term is 1 and the seventh term is  1
9 .

16.3   Using the formula    Tn = arn – 1  
When all but one from the first term ( a)" common ratio ( r), nth term Tn  and n, of a 
geometric progression are given, the unknown value can be found by substituting 
the given values into Tn = arn – 1' 
consider at the following examples '
Example  1
Find the first term of the geometric progression with common ratio 3 and 4th term  
54'  
r = 3,  n = 4, Tn = 54
   Tn  = arn – 1
                      ... T4   = a  (3)4 – 1
                   ...   54 
  =   a   (3)3 
                     ...  54  = a  27             
              ... a  = 54
27 
       = 2
 The first term of the sequence is 2 '
127Example  2
Find the common ratio of the geometric progression with first term 5 and 7th term  
320, and list the first five terms. 
a = 5,  n = 7, T7 = 320
  Tn  = ar(n – 1)
 T7   = 5  (r)7 – 1
  ...320 
 = 5  (r)6 
  
                   ...    r6
   = 320
 5 
      = 64
      = (+2)6 or (–2)6
   ...   r 
 = 2  or – 2
There are two values for the common ratio. Hence, there are two geometric 
progressions satisfying the given conditions. 
    First five terms of the progression with r 
 = 2 are 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 '
  First five terms of the progression  with r 
 = – 2 are 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80'

          ( n – 1)   = 6
              n = 6 + 1
                 = 7         ... it is the 7th term that is equal to  1
64 .  
128Example  4
The first term of a geometric progression, is 160 and the 6th term is 1215. Find the 
common ratio of the progression. 
a = 160,  T6 = 1215, n = 6
 Tn  = ar(n – 1)
                     
1215   = 160 (r)6 – 1
                      160r5

... The common ratio is  11

Similarly, when any two terms of a geometric progression are given,   Tn = arn – 1 
can be used to find the first term and the common ratio. Consider the following 
example.   
Example  5
Find the common ratio and the first term of the geometric progression with 3rd term 
48 and 6th term 3072. 
Let us first construct two equations from the given information.

16.4 The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression
The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression with first term a and common 
ratio r is denoted by  Sn' Let us now consider finding a formula for Sn '
We can write the first n terms of the geometric progression as,
 T1 = a, T2 = ar, T3 = ar2, T4 = ar3, ...., Tn = ar (n – 1).
 Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...... + Tn
... Sn = a + ar + ar2 +ar3 + ............ + ar (n – 1) 1 .
We use the following technique to find a formula for Sn. First we will multiply both 
sides of equation  1 by  r. Then we get,
 r Sn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + ............ + ar n  2 '
Now, when we subtract 1  from 2, we get "
r Sn – Sn = arn – a ^observe that many terms on the right hand side cancel &
 ... Sn  (r –1) = a (rn –1)
 ...Sn =  a (rn –1)
(r –1)  (r ≠ 1)
This is an expression for Sn in terms of a, r, n. By multiplying both the numerator 
and the denominator of the right hand side by – 1, we can also express it as
 Sn = a (1– rn)
(1– r)
132To find Sn , one can use either Sn = a (r n –1)
(r –1) or Sn = a (1– r n )
(1– r) appropriately.
Example  1
Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric progression  2, 6, 18, ..., both 
by finding the first five terms and adding them up, and by using the formula for Sn .
Let us first find the sum by adding all five terms. We are given that 
T1 = 2, T2 = 6 and T3 = 18 
Moreover, 
T4 = 18   3 = 54 and 
T5 = 54   3 = 162 .
Therefore " S5 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5
 = 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162
 = 242
Now let us use  Sn = a (rn –1 )    
(r –1) to find the sum. 
Because  a = 2,  r = 6
2 = 3,  n = 5.  
           and    Sn = a (rn – 1)
r – 1
   S5 = 2 (35 – 1)
3 – 1
    = 2 (243 – 1)
  2
    = 2  242
  2
    = 242
Sum of the first five terms is 242'
When the values of the terms are large or when there are many terms to add, it is 
easier to to use the formula for Sn. 
133Example  2
Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric progression 120,  – 60, 30, .... 
using the formula. 
 a = 120,  r = – 60
120 = – 1
2,  n = 6
Substituting into     Sn = a (1 – rn)
1 – r gives us
S6 = 
1 – 1
2–120 1 – 1
2– 6
 = 
 3
2120 1 – 1
64 
 = 120  63
64  .. 3
2
 = 120  63
64  2
3
= 315
4
= 78 3
4
Therefore, the sum of the first six terms is  78 3
4 '
There are four unknowns in the formula Sn  =  a (1 – rn)
1 – r. These are   a, r, n  and Sn' 
When any three of these are given, we can find the value of the remaining unknown 
by using this formula. Let us consider some examples of this type.
Example  3
Find how many terms of the initial terms need to be added from the geometric 
progression 5, 15, 45, ... in order for the sum to be equal to 1820. 
 a = 5,  r = 15 
5 = 3,  Sn = 1820
 Sn = a (rn –1)
r –1
134             1820 = 5 (3n – 1)
3 – 1
             1820 = 5 (3n – 1)
  2
        2  1820 = 5 (3n – 1) 
    2  1820
 5 = 3n – 1 
               728 = 3n – 1
        1 + 728 = 3n
                         729 = 3n
                              36 = 3n
  n = 6
First six terms need to be added.

In this section we will discuss various types of problems related to geometric 
progressions, that we have not discussed above.
Example  1

and the sum of the 4th and 5th terms is equal to – 72. Find the first 5 terms of the 
progression. 
 T1 = a,  T2 = ar
               a + ar = 9
            a (1 + r) = 9 1
 T4 = ar3,  T5 = ar4
                     ar3 + ar4 = – 72
           ar3 (1 + r) = – 72 2
2  1      ar3(1 + r)
a (1 + r)=  – 72
 9
                       r3
 = – 8
            r3
 = (– 2)3
                     r = – 2
Substituting r = – 2, to 1 
 a [1 + ( – 2)] = 9
       a  (– 1) = 9
                  a = – 9
First five terms of the progression are
 – 9, 18, – 36, 72, – 144'
Example  2

    r = x +12
 x +2 = x + 42
x + 12 
                       x +12
 x +2 = x + 42
x + 12 
(x + 12) (x + 12) = (x + 2) (x + 42)
136   x2 + 24 x + 144 = x2 + 44 x + 84
     144  – 84 = 20 x
             60 = 20 x
       x = 60

         x = 3
