viiiMessage of the Board of Compilers
This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be 
implemented from 2015. 
Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to 
compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to 
read and understand it on your own. 
 
We have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject 
concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are 
organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. 
We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the 
glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official 
Languages.
Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject 
content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin -
ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them 
for the subject content of grade 11.
In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need 
to recall previuos knoweledge.
You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and       
doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them 
in the classroom.
We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful  and productive 
experience.

By studying this lesson will be able to
 ² to investigate number sets
 ² workout basic mathematical operations regarding surds.
It is believed that the concept of numbers originated among the human race about 
30 000 years ago. This concept which originated and developed independently in 
various civilizations, evolved globally and has now become a universal field of 
study named mathematics.
It can be assumed that numbers were initially used in early civilizations for simple 
purposes such as counting and accounting. There is no doubt that the first numerical 
concepts that were developed were “one” and “two”.  Later the concepts of three, 
four etc., must have been developed. Then man would have realized that he could 
name any amount that he wished in this manner. Different civilizations used 
different symbols to name numbers.
It is accepted based on historical evidence, that the numerals 1, 2, 3 etc., which we 
now use, originated in India.  The honour of being the first to use the concept of zero 
as a number as well as being the first to introduce the positional decimal number 
system also goes to India. This number system is now defined as the Hindu-Arabic 
number system and the modern belief is that it was first taken to the Middle-East 
and then to Europe by traders. This system is the standard number system which is 
accepted and used worldwide now.
The manipulation of numbers using the basic mathematical operations (addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division) can be considered as a great revolution in 
the history of mankind in relation to the use of numbers.  In this age of technology it 
is unimaginable to think of the existence of man without numbers and the operations 
performed on them.
Although the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., can be considered as the first numbers that were 
used to fulfill certain needs of man, later the number zero, fractional numbers and 
negative numbers were also included in the number system. During the period when 
mathematics was developing as a separate field, the attention of mathematicians 
was directed towards various other types of numbers (sets) too. In this lesson we 
hope to study about such sets of numbers, their notations and properties.

For free distributionThe Set of Integers  ()
It is natural that we identify initially the numbers 1, 2, 3, … which we first learnt 
about as children. These numbers are defined as counting numbers  and the set 
which consists of all these numbers is written using set notation as follows.
{1, 2, 3, …}
The reason for this set of numbers to be called the counting numbers is very clear.  
However its mathematical usage in modern times is limited.  The name used most 
often now for this set is “ the set of positive integers ”. This set is denoted by +.
   
Thus,  + = {1, 2, 3, ...}.
That is, the numbers 1, 2, 3, … are called positive integers.
The numbers defined as negative integers are  – 1,  – 2,  – 3, etc. Although there is 
no commonly used symbol to denote this set, some mathematicians, based on the 
needs of their field of study, use the symbol –.
The positive integers, zero and the negative integers together form the set of 
integers . This set is denoted by . Accordingly,
 =  { ..., – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
or equivalently,
                        =  {0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ... }.
The Set of Natural Numbers   ()
Let us consider again the set of numbers 1, 2, 3,... This set is also defined as the set 
of natural numbers  and is denoted by '
   That is,  = {1, 2, ...}.
Note : There is no consensus among mathematicians regarding which numbers 
should be considered as natural numbers. The suitability of calling the numbers 
1,2,3, … natural numbers is clear. However some of the mathematicians (especially 
specialists in set theory), have considered 0 as a natural number in their books.

3
For free distributionOne reason may be because at that time there was no accepted name nor accepted 
symbol for the set consisting of 0 and the positive integers.However most books on 
number theory consider the set of natural numbers to be the set {1,2, 3,...}.Almost 
all authors of mathematics books now mention at the beginning of their books 
which set of numbers they consider as the natural numbers.
The set of Rational Number s ()
We have come across earlier that, like the integers, fractions too can be considered 
as numbers, and that operations such as addition and multiplication can be 
performed on them too. Every integer can be written as a fraction. (For example, 
we can write  2 = 2
1). Further, a fraction can be written in different forms, all having 
the same numerical value. (For example,  1
2 = 2
4 = 3
6). We have also come across 
negative fractions  ^– 2
5, – 11
3, etc.&' Although we usually think that the numerator 
and denominator of a frac tion should consist of integers, this is actually not the 
case. For example, 3
2 is also a fraction. However, fractions with integers in both 
the numerator and the denominator (apart from 0 in the denominator), have an 
important place in mathematics. They are called rational numbers . The set of 
rational numbers is denoted by  . Accordingly, the set of rational numbers can be 
defined using the set builder notation as follows.
  ={ a
b : a, b   and b ≠ 0 }.
There are other ways too of defining the set of rational numbers. One other way is 
as follows.   
                                                           ={ a
b : a   , b  + }.
Both these definitions are equivalent. Since the denominator of a rational number 
cannot be 0 and since all the negative rational numbers can be obtained by 
considering the fractions with the negative integers in the numerator and positive 
integers in the denominator.

For free distributionThe Set of Irrational Numbers   
It is appropriate to define the irrational numbers now. Do you recall how you learnt 
about numbers in previous grades by drawing a number line?  Let us reconsider 
this now.
Let us consider a straight line which can be lengthened as required in either 
direction. Let us name a point we like on that line as the origin 0. Let us assume 
that we have marked all the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on one side of 0 (usually the right  
hand side) and all the numbers – 1, – 2, – 3 etc., on the opposite side, keeping equal 
gaps between the numbers.  That is, let us assume that the points corresponding to 
all the integers have been marked on this number line. Let us also assume that the 
points corresponding to all the rational numbers too have been marked on this line.  
The figure below shows several such points that have been marked.
1
2211 0 3  – 1  – 2  – 3 8
3– 7
5
Accordingly, all the rational numbers (including the integers) are now assumed 
to have been marked on this line. Now, do you think that corresponding to each 
point on the line, a number has been marked? If asked differently, do you think that 
the distance from 0 to each point on the line can be written as a rational number? 
In truth, there are several points remaining on the number line which have not 
been marked.  That is, there are points remaining on this number line that cannot 
be represented by a rational number. It is clear that the points that are remaining 
are those which correspond to the numbers which cannot  be written in the form                       
 a
b, where a and b are integers. The numbers which correspond to the remaining 
points are defined as irrational numbers.
There is no specific symbol to denote the set of irrational numbers and it is usually 
denoted by , the complement of the set  . The numbers   2" 3" 5 can be 
given as examples of irrational numbers. In fact, the square root of any positive 
integer which is not a perfect square is an irrational number. Apart from these, 
mathematicians have proved that π, which is the ratio of the circumference of any 
circle to its  diameter, is also an irrational number. We take the value of π to be  22
7
as an approximate value, for the convenience of performing calculations.

For free distributionThe Set of Real Numbers  ()
According to the above discussion, all the numbers on a number line can be 
represented by rational numbers or irrational numbers. We call all the rational 
numbers together with all the irrational numbers, that is, all the numbers that can be 
represented on a number line, the real numbers . The set of real numbers is denoted 
by .
The Decimal Representation of a Number
Any real number can be represented as a decimal number. Initially, let us consider 
the decimal representation of several rational numbers.
1. The decimal representation of a rational number
 4 = 4.000 ...
  1
2 = 0.5 = 0.5000 ...
 
  11
8= 1.375 = 1.375000 ...
  211
99= 2.131313...
  767
150= 5.11333...
   37
7 = 5.285714285714285714 ...
A common property of these decimal representations is that starting at a certain 
point to the right of the decimal point (or from the beginning), one set of numerals 
(or one numeral) is recurring. Recurring means that it keeps repeating itself. 
For example, in the decimal representation of   1
2, the numeral 0 recurs starting from 
the second decimal place. The numeral 0 recurs from the first decimal place in the 
decimal representation of 4, the pair of numerals 13 recurs from the beginning in 
the decimal representation of  211
99and the  group of numerals 285714 recurs from 
the beginning in the decimal representation of   37
7. This property, that is, a group 
of numerals recurring continuously, is a property common to all rational numbers.  
If the portion that recurs is just 0, such a decimal representation is defined as a 
finite decimal  (or terminating decimal ). The decimals of which the portion that 
6
For free distributionrecurs is not zero, are called recurring decimals . Accordingly, 1
2" 4 and 11
8in the 
above example are finite decimals while the rest are recurring decimals.  
The above discussion leads to the following statement.
Every rational number can be written as a finite decimal or a recurring 
decimal.
Let us now learn a marvelous result regarding rational numbers. Suppose the  
rational number   a
bhas a finite decimal representation. Let us assume that a and 
b have no common factors.  Then the denominator (that is, b) has only powers of 
2 or 5 (or both) as its factors. A rational number which has a recurring decimal 
representation must have a prime factor other than 2 and 5 in its denominator.
Recurring decimals are written in a concise form, by placing a dot above a numeral 
or numerals as shown in the following examples to indicate that they are recurring.

For free distribution2. The decimal representation of an irrational number
Finally, let us consider the decimal representation of an irrational number. In the 
decimal representation of an irrational number, no group of numerals recurs. For 
example, when the decimal representation of  2is written down up to 60 decimal 
places, we obtain the following:  
1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679
π, which is a number we come across often is also an irrational number. When the 
value of π is calculated up to 60 decimal places we obtain the following:
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944
 
The following statements can be made regarding irrational numbers.
There is no group of recurring numerals in the decimal representation of an 
irrational number . If the decimal representation of a number is not finite, it is 
called an infinite decimal . Accordingly rational numbers which are recurring 
decimals and irrational numbers have infinite decimal representations.
Note : When describing the decimal representation of irrational numbers, one 
frequent error that is made is stating that “there is no pattern in the decimal 
representation of an irrational number”. The issue here is that the word “pattern” is 
not well defined in mathematics. For example, the following decimal number has 
a very clear pattern.
0.101001000100001000001...
However, this is an irrational number, Observe that there is no group of recurring 
numbers.
All the sets of numbers that have been studied so far can be represented in a Venn 
diagram as follows, with the set of real numbers as the universal set, and the other 
sets as its subsets. A few numbers belonging to each subset have been included to 
make it easier for you to understand the relationship between the sets.

For free distribution1.2 Surds
There is no doubt that you recall how  numerical (and algebraic) expressions are 
written using the symbol  
˜
  ˜ which is defined as the radical sign. For example, 
4 is defined as the positive square root  of 4 and it represents the positive number 
which when squared is equal to 4; that is 2. The positive square root is referred to 
as square root too. If a certain positive integer x is such that its square root x  is 
also a positive integer, then x is defined as a perfect square.  Accordingly, 4 is a 
perfect square. Since 4 is equal to 2. However, 2 is not the square root of a 
perfect square. We observed earlier that 2  is approximately equal to 1.414. We 
also learnt earlier in this lesson that 2 is an irrational number. A numerical term 
involving the symbol  of which the value is not a rational number is defined as 
a surd.
The radical sign — ˜ is used not only to denote the square roots of numbers, 
but also other roots. For example, 23  denotes the positive number which when 
raised to the power 3 is equal to 2. This is called the cube root of 2. This is also an 
irrational number.  Its value is approximately 1.2599. (You can verify this by finding 
the value of 1.25993).  We can define the fourth root of 2 and the fifth root of 2 etc., 
in a similar manner. Such definitions can be made for other positive numbers as 
well; for example, 53 and  8.246. Such expressions are also surds. However, in 
this lesson we will only consider surds which are square roots of positive integers.
The square root of a positive integer which is not a perfect square is neither a finite 
decimal nor a recurring decimal. Observe that surds are therefore always irrational 
numbers.
Here our focus is on simplifying expressions which involve surds. There are many 
reasons why such simplifications are important. One reason is that it facilitates 
calculations. For example, when it is necessary to find the value of 21, if we 
take 2 to be approximately equal to 1.414, we would need to find the value of         
1.4141. This division is fairly lo ng. However, by simplifying this in the following 
manner, calculations are made easier.
    21
21=22
   ^Multiplying the numerator and denominator by  2&
  22=
  21.414= =0.707.
Another reason for simplifying surds is to minimize errors during calculations.
10
For free distributionFor example, let us find the value of  20
2– 5 . Let us use 4.5 as an approximate 
value for 20  , and 2.2 as an approximate value for 5. Then
 20
2– 5= 
= 
= 4.5
2– 2.2
2.25 – 2.2
0.05  
However, the actual value of this expression is 0. One reason for getting a different 
answer is because we used approximate values for 20 and 5. However, by 
simplifying the above expression in a different way, we can get the correct value 
which is 0. 
Surds appear in various form.
A special feature of a surd of the form 20  is that the whole number is under the 
radical sign. Such surds are defined as entire surds .  6 15  means 6 × 15. This 
is a product of a surd and a rational number (not equal to 1).  This is not an entire 
surd.
A surd is in its simplest form when it is in the form a b; where a is a rational 
number and b has no factors which are perfect squares. For example 6 15 is in its 
simplest form but 5 12 is not, since 4 which is a perfect square is a factor of 12.
Now let us consider how to simplify expressions that contain surds of various forms.
Example  1
Simplify 3 5 +  6 5.
This can be simplified by considering 5  to be an unknown term.
 3 5 +  6 5= 9 5.
This simplification is similar to the simplification 3 x + 6x = 9x. 
Observe that the expression obtained above in surd form cannot be simplified 
further. Keep in mind that simplifying further by using an approximate value for 
5 is not what is meant by simplifying surds.
You should also keep in mind the important fact that an expression of the form 
3 2 + 8 3 cannot be simplified further.
Now let us through examples, consider how expressions with surds are simplified 
by applying the properties of indices.

Next let us consider how multiplication and division are performed on surds.
Example  4 
Simplify:   5 3   4 2 .
Let us multiply the rational and irrational parts separately.
5 3   4 2  =  5    4    3  2 
 =  20  3  2  
 =  20 6 
Example  5 
Simplify: 3 20 ..2 5.
The surd 3  20  can be written as  3 4  5. Simplifying further, it can be written 
as 3  2 5  =  6 5

For free distributionNext we will consider how expressions of the form ba are simplified. Examples 
for such expressions are 23 and 54. Expression of this form has a square root term 
in the denominator. 
Now let us consider how such an expression can be converted into an expression 
with an integer (or a rational number) in the denominator.
Example  6 
Express 23 as a fraction with an integer in the denominator.
The method used here is, to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 
23    by 2 
   2=              =              2 23
23 2

This process is defined as rationalizing  the denominator .

Now let us consider how an expression involving surds is simplified.
Example  8 
Simplify  4  63 – 5 7 –  8 28 .
4 63 = 4  9  7   = 4  3  7
  = 12 7
8 28 = 8  4  7  = 8  2  7  
  = 16 7 
Therefore   4 63 – 5  7 – 8 28 = 12 7 –  5 7 – 16 7 
       = – 9  Example  8 
Simplify  4  63 – 5 7 –  8 28 .
4 63 = 4  9  7   = 4  3  7
  = 12 7
8 28 = 8  4  7  = 8  2  7  
  = 16 7 
Therefore   4 63 – 5  7 – 8 28 = 12 7 –  5 7 – 16 7 
       = – 9 7

2.1 Fractional Indices of a Power
 
Square root of 4 can be written either using the radical symbol (square root symbol) 
as 4√  or using powers as 41
2 '
Therefore, it is clear that 4√=    41
2'
Let us consider another example, similar to the above. As 2 = 21,
 2  2  2 = 21  21  21 
            = 23
                          = 8
Third power of 2 is 8 ' Thus, the cube root of 8 is 2. This can be denoted symbolically 
as"  
 8√=  23 or  81
3  =  2.
Therefore it is clear that  8√=  81
3 3'
Futhermore, if  a  is a positive real number, then  
         a√ = a1
2 ,
        3a√ = a1
3 and
       4a√  = a1
4'  
Thus, the general relationship between the radical symbol and the exponent (index)
of a power can be expressed as follows.
  
                 na√ = a1
n 
The following examples demonstrate how the above relationship can be used to 
simplify expressions involving powers.

2.2 Solving Equations with Indices
2x = 23 is an equation. Because the bases of the powers on either side of the equal 
sign are equal, the exponents must be equal. Thus, from 2x = 23 , we can conclude 
that x = 3'
Similarly, on either side of the equation x5 = 25 are powers with equal exponents.  
Because the indices are equal, the bases are also equal.  Therefore, from  x5 = 25 
we can conclude that x = 2' If x2 = 32 then the indices are equal but in this case, 
both + 3 and  − 3 are solutions. The reason for two solutions arising is because the 
exponent — 2 ˜ is an even number.  In this lesson, we will only consider powers with 
20 21For free distribution For free distributiona positive base. Thus, in expressions of the form xm ,  x > 0'
There is a special property of powers of 1. All powers of 1 are equal to 1. That is, 
for any m, 1m = 1'
Let us summarise the above observations.   
For x > 0, y > 0, y  ≠ 1 and x ≠ 1,
                 if  x ≠ 0 xm = xn,  then  m = n'
if m ≠ 0 and  xm = ym,  then x = y'
Let us use these rules to solve equations with indices. 
Example 1
Solve.
(i) 4x = 64  (ii) x3 = 343  (iii) 3  92x − 1 = 27−x 
(i) 4x = 64  (ii) x3 = 343             (iii)    3  92x − 1 = 27−x
      3  (32) 2x − 1 = (3)3(−x)
      3  32 ( 2x − 1) = 3−3x
                 3 1 + 4 x − 2  = 3−3x
  ∴  1 + 4 x − 2  =  −3x
             4 x + 3x = 2 − 1
                     7 x = 1
                       x  =    1
   7 
                        4x = 43 x3 = 73              
	∴	x = 3                        ∴ x = 7

22 23For free distribution For free distribution2.3  Laws of logarithms
We know that, using the laws of logarithms, we can write
log2 (16    32) = log216 + log232 and log2 (32 .. 16) = log232 – log216. These laws, 
in general, can be written as follows.  
  loga (mn) = loga m + loga n
 loga m
n = loga m – loga n 
Let us learn another law of a similar type. 
Consider log51254 as an example.
 log51254 = log5 (125  125  125  125)
  = log5125 + log5125 + log5125 + log5125
  = 4 log5125
Similarly,  
 log10105 = 5 log1010 and
 log352 = 2 log35 
This observation can be written, in general, as the following  logarithmic law '
  loga mr = r logam
This law is even valid for expressions with fractional indices. Given below are a 
few examples, where this law is applied to powers with fractional indices.

                    Right Side  = log5 40 – log58 + 1
                            = log5 40 
8 + 1
                             = log5 5 + 1
           = 1 + 1
           = 2
									∴	 log575 – log5 3 = log5 40 –  log58 + 1

Logarithms
103 = 1000 can be written using logarithms as  log10 1000 = 3. As a convention 
we write "lg" instead of "log10 ". Now we can express the above expression as                                           
lg 1000 = 3. It is important to mention the base if it is other than 10 '
For example "
    log5 25 = 2  because 52 = 25, 
      lg 1 = 0  because 100 = 1" and
    lg 10 = 1  because 101 = 10'
The logarithm of any positive number can be found using the  table of logarithms.

According to the above table, the characteristic of the logarithm of numbers 
inbetween 0 and 1, coming after 5.432 in the first column, are negative ' Even 
though the characteristic is negative, the mantissa of the logarithm, which is found 
using the table, is a positive number. The symbol —−˜ is used above the whole part 
to indicate that only the characteristic is negative. It is read as " bar". 
For example,  2  −.3725 is read as "bar two point three, seven, two, five" ' Moreover, 
what is represented by  2  −.3725  is − 2 + 0.3725 '
The characteristic  of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. The 
characteristic of the logarithm of such a number can be obtained either by writing 
it in scientific notation or by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point. 
The characteristic  of the logarithm can be obtained by adding one to the number 
of zeros after the decimal point (and before the next non-zero digit) and taking its 
negative value. Observe it in the above table too.
 Example
 0.004302 Number of zeros after the decimal point and before the next
 non-zero digit is 2. Therefore characteristic of the logarithm 
is 3−
30
For free distribution 0.04302 Number of zeros after the decimal point is 1; thus the 
characteristic of the logarithm is 2−    
 0.4302 Number of zeros after the decimal point is 0; thus the 
characteristic of the logarithm is  1−
 
Therefore,  lg 0.004302  = 3−.6337' 
When written using indices, it is;  
0.004302 = 103−.6337' This can also be written as " 0.004302 = 10 −3   100.6337'
Do the following exercise to practice taking logarithms of numbers between                
0 and 1.

3.2 Number corresponding to a logarithm (antilog)
Let us recall how the antilog of a number greater than 1 is obtained. 
antilog 2.7421 = 5.522  102  
     = 552.2 
When a number is written in scientific form, the index of the power of 10 is the 
characteristic  of the logarithm of that number. The characteristic  of the logarithm 
indicates the number of places that the decimal point needs to be shifted when 
taking the antilog.   
Thus, we obtained 552.2 by shifting the decimal point of  5.522 two places to the 
right. However, when the characteristic is negative the decimal point is shifted to 
the left side. 
31
For free distribution antilog  2−. 7421  =  5.522   10 −2         (Decimal point needs to be shifted 2 places to the 
left)
(Because of  bar 2, there is one 0 after the decimal
point)
(Decimal place needs to be shifted one place to 
the left)
(Because of  bar 1, there are no zeros after the 
decimal place ) =  0.05522
antilog  1−. 7421  =  5.522   10 −1
  =  0.5522

3.3 Addition and subtraction of logarithms with negative 
characteristics
(a) Addition
The mantissa of a logarithm is obtained from the table of logarithms and is always 
positive. But we now know that, the characteristic  can be positive, negative or 
zero. In 2−. 5143, the mantissa, .5143, is positive and the characteristic , 2−, is 
negative ' When adding or subtracting such numbers, it is important to simplify the 
characteristic  and the mantissa separately. 
Example 1

(i) 2−. 5143  +  1−. 2375  = − 2 + 0.5143 +( − 1 ) + 0.2375
         = (− 2 − 1) + (0.5143 + 0.2375)
 = − 3 + 0.7518

      = − 1 + 1.2353 
 = − 1 + 1 + 0.2353
     = 0.2353  
                                                 
(iii)  3− . 8753 + 1.3475  = − 3 + 0.8753 + 1 + 0.3475
         = (− 3 + 1) + (0.8753 + 0.3475)
 = − 2 + 1.2228
     = − 2 + 1 + 0.2228
 =  1−. 2228
(b) Subtraction
As in addition, logarithms should be subtracted from right to left, remembering that 
the mantissa is positive. 
Example 2 
Simplify and express the answer in log form.
(i) 2−. 5143 − 1.3143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (1 + 0.3143)

  = 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
  = 3 − 0.4000
  = 2.6000
                                       
(iii) 0.2143 − 1−. 8143 = 0.2143 − (− 1 + 0.8143)                       
  = 0.2143 + 1 − 0.8143
  = 1 − 0.6000
  = 0.4 
                                       
(iv) 2−. 5143 − 1−. 9143 = − 2 + 0.5143 − (− 1 + 0.9143)            
  = − 2 + 0.5143 + 1 − 0.9143
  =  − 2 + 1 + 0.5143 − 0.9143
  = −1 − 0.4000
     
33
For free distribution In the above example, the decimal part is negative. Because we need the decimal 
part of a logarithm to be positive, we will use a trick as follows to make it positive.  
 − 1 −  0.4 = − 1 − 1 +  1 − 0.4  (Because − 1 + 1 = 0, we have not changed the value ')                        
 = − 2 + 0.6
 =   2− . 6
Actually what we have done is add − 1 to the characteristic and + 1 to the mantissa.
Note: We could have avoided getting a negative decimal part by doing the 
simplification as follows. 
 
 − 2 + 0.5143 + 1  − 0.9143 =  − 2 + 1.5143 − 0.9143 = − 2 + 0.6 =  2− . 6

For free distribution3.5 Multiplication and division of a logarithm of a number by a 
whole number  
We know that the characteristic of a number greater than one is positive. Multiplying 
or dividing such a logarithm by a  number can be done in the usual way.
We know that the characteristic  of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is 
negative. 3−. 8247 is such a logarithm. When multiplying or dividing a logarithm 
with a negative characteristic  by a number, we simplify the characteristic  and the 
mantissa separately.

Division of a logarithm by a whole number
Let us now consider how to divide a logarithm by a whole number. When the 
characteristic  of a logarithm is negative the characteristic  and the mantissa carry 
negative and positive values respectively. Therefore, it is important to divide the 
positive part and the negative part separately. Let us now consider some examples 
of this type.

Let us consider in the following example, how division is done when the whole part 
is not perfectly divisible.

Because the whole part,  1−, is not perfectly divisible by 2, let us write it as  2− + 1' 
Now, we  can perform the division as follows
  a.    1− . 5412 ÷ 2 =  ( − 1 + 0.5412)  ÷ 2

               =  0.5179 – 0.4771
  =  0.0408
      ∴    V =  antilog 0.0408
              =  1.098    
  ≈  1.1   (to the nearest first decimal place) 
  ∴ The volume of the sphere is  1.1 cm3.

Carefully observe the solid objects in the above figure. Note that their faces are 
polygons. Of these faces, the horizontal face at the bottom is called the base. All the 
faces, except the base are of triangular shape. The common point of these triangular 
faces is called the "apex". A solid object with these properties is called a "pyramid". 
Note that the bases of the Pyramids shown above are respectively, the shape of a 
quadrilateral, a pentagon and a hexagon.

square. All the remaining faces are triangular 
in shape. If the line segment connecting the 
apex and the midpoint of the square base (that 
is the intersection point of the two diagonals) 
is perpendicular to the base, then such a 
pyramid is called a " square based right 
pyramid ". The length of the line segment 
connecting the apex and the midpoint of the 
base is called the perpendicular height  (or 
simply the height) of the pyramid. The edges of the triangular faces which are not 
common to the base are called slant edges . In this lesson, we will only consider 
finding the surface area of square  based right pyramids.  Surface area of solids 4
By studying this lesson you will be able to " 
 ² find the surface area of a right pyramid with a square base,
 ² find the surface area of a right circular cone, and
 ² find the surface area of a sphere. 
50 51For free distribution For free distributionNote : A tetrahedron can also be considered as a pyramid. All the faces of a 
tetrahedron are triangular in shape. Any one of the faces can be taken as the base.
The concept of —right pyramid ˜ can be defined even when the base is not a square. 
For example, we can define a right pyramid when the base of a pyramid is a 
regular polygon, as follows. First note that all the axes of symmetry of a regular 
polygon pass through a common point, which is called the centroid of the regular 
polygon. A pyramid, having a base which is a regular polygon, is called a right 
pyramid, if the line segment connecting the apex and the centroid of the base is 
perpendicular to the base. 
If you study mathematics further, you will learn how to define the centroid, even 
when the base is not a regular polygon. 
An important property of a square based right pyramid is that all its triangular faces 
are congruent to each other. Therefore, all the triangular faces have the same area. 
Moreover, note that each triangular face is an isosceles or an equilateral triangle, 
with one side a side of the square base and the other two sides equal in length. 
4.1 Surface area of a square based right pyramid
To find the total surface area of a square based right pyramid we need to add the 
areas of the base and the four triangular faces.
Suppose the length of a side of the square base is —a˜ and  the perpendicular height 
of a triangular face is " l".

the line segment connecting the apex and 
the centre of the circular base is 
perpendicular to the circular base of a 
right circle cone. The radius of the base 
circle is called the radius of the cone. The 
length of the line segment connecting the 
centre of the base and the apex is the 
perpendicular height of a right circular cone. Moreover, any line segment connecting 
the apex and a point on the perimeter of the base circle is called a generator of the 
cone. The length of a generator is called the "slant height " of the cone. 
It is customary to use —r˜ for the radius, —h˜ for the height and —l˜ for the slant height 
of a cone.
4.2 Surface area of a right circular cone
To explain a method to find the surface area of a right circular cone, consider a 
hollow right circular cone made from a thin sheet. Observe that the base of such a 
cone is a circular plane surface. Cutting open the curved surface along a generator, 
gives a lamina, the shape of a circular sector. 
Given the radius and the slant height of a right circular cone, one can find surface 
area of the cone, by finding the area of the circular base and the area of the curved 
surface.  We can use the formula πr2 to find the area of the circular base. We can find 
the area of the circular sector as follows.  
56 57For free distribution For free distribution A
Ol

r
Curved surface    Circular base2πr

l B
    
The surface area of the curved surface is equal to the area of the sector that is 
obtained by cutting it open. Because the arc length of the sector is the circumference 
of the base circle, the arc length of the sector is equal to 2 πr. Also note that the 
radius of this sector is the slant height —l˜. Now, as you have learned in the lesson 
on the perimeter of a circular sector in Grade 10, if the angle of the sector is θ then     
θ
360× 2πl=2πr.  ∴  θ=2πl2πr × 360  i . e,  θ=l360r
The area of the sector with the above angle θ (as learnt in grade 10) is θ
360× πl 2.
By substituting θ from the  above equation, we get ×l360r
360πl 2. Accordingly the 
area of the curved surface of the cone is πrl. 
Now we can add both areas, to get the total surface area of the cone. 
 Total surface area of 
the conearea of the curved 
surface of the conearea of the circular 
base=
=  πrl + πr2+   
If the total surface area is  A

lesson let us take the value of π as 22

There is no doubt that you know what properties a sphere has. In mathematics, 
a sphere is defined as the set of points in three dimensional space that lies at  a 
constant distance from a fixed point.  The fixed point is called the centre of the 
sphere and the constant distance from the centre to a point on the sphere is called 
the radius of the sphere. A sphere has only one curved surface, and has no edges or 
vertices.

We will usually use " r" to indicate the radius of the sphere. 
60 61For free distribution For free distribution4.3 Surface area of a sphere
A cylinder with the same radius as the sphere and  height equal to the diameter of 
the sphere is called the circumscribing  cylinder  of the sphere. The sphere will 
tightly fit in the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere.

Q C BrThe following fact regarding the surface area of a sphere 
and its circumscribing cylinder was observed by the 
Greek mathematician  Archimedes, who lived around 
225 B.C. 
When the sphere is inside the circumscribing cylinder, 
any two planes parallel to the  flat circular surfaces 
of the cylinder  will bound equal surface areas on the 
curved surfaces of the sphere and cylinder.   
For example, in the above figure, the area of the curved surface PQRS on the sphere 
is the same as the area of the curved surface ABCD on the cylinder.   
Now, if we apply this fact to the entire cylinder, we see that the surface area of 
the sphere is equal to the surface area of the curved surface of the cylinder. We 
can use the formulae 2 πrh to find the surface area of the curved surface of the 
circumscribing cylinder. 
Area of the curved surface of the circumscribing cylinder = 2 πr  2r
                                          = 4πr2
            Therefore, the surface area of the sphere =  4 πr2
If the surface area is A,
              A = 4πr 2

Recall the circumscribing cylinder of a sphere, that we leaned about in the lesson on 
the surface area of a sphere. Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who explained 
the surface area of a sphere in terms of the circumscribing cylinder,  also explained  
the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.  Let 
us do the following activity to understand his finding. 
 
 Activity

 with the same radius as that of the sphere and height equal to the diameter of the     
 sphere. Do not close the two ends of the cylinder. Now carefully insert the sphere  
 into the cylinder.

over and fill the remaining part that is not occupied by the sphere also with sand.  
Put the total amount of sand that you used to fill the remaining volume of the 
cylinder after inserting the sphere into the cone that you made earlier. Note that the 
volume of sand fills the cone completely. 
    
  2 rr
    
Let us formulate what you have observed in this activity. 
V olume of the Circumscribing Cylinder  = V olume of the Sphere + V olume of the 
Cone  
Therefore, we can find the volume of the sphere by subtracting the volume of the 
cone from the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.    
V olume of the Sphere  = V olume of the Circumscribing Cylinder  – V olume of the 
Cone

By studying this lesson, you will be able to
 expand the cube (third power) of a binomial expression. 
You have learned in earlier lessons that, for a binomial expression of the form                  
x + y, its square is denoted by ( x + y)2, and that what it means is ( x + y) (x + y), 
and that when the product is expanded, the expression x2 + 2xy + y2  is obtained. 
Moreover, recall that x2 – 2xy + y2  is obtained when (x – y)2  is expanded. 
Do the following exercise to recall what you have learned about the expansion of 
squares of binomial expressions.

6.1 Cube of a binomial expression
The cube of the binomial expression a + b , is (a + b)3 . That is, the third power of    
(a + b) ' Note that this is the same as multiplying ( a + b)2  again by ( a + b).
74 75For free distribution For free distributionCarefully observe how the following expressions, involving a power of 3, are 
written.  
         33 = 3 × 32 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 
         x3 = x × x 2 = x × x × x
  (2x)3 = (2x) × (2 x)2 = (2x) × (2 x) × (2 x) = 8 x3
In a similar way, we can write
  (x + 1)3 = (x + 1)( x + 1)2  = (x + 1) ( x + 1) ( x + 1)
 ( a – 2)3  =  (a – 2)( a – 2)2  = (a – 2) ( a – 2) ( a – 2)
 (3 + m)3 = (3 + m)(3 + m)2 =  (3 + m) (3 + m) (3 + m)  
The cube of a binomial expression can be expanded in a way similar to how the 
square of a binomial expression was expanded. It is illustrated in the following 
example ' 
Example 1 
(x + y)3  = (x + y) (x + y) 2
                       
  
  = x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3
  = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 = (x + y)    (x2+ 2xy +y2)
Accordingly,  let us remember the following pattern as a formula for the expansion 
of the cube of the binomial expression ( x + y).  
  (x + y)3  =  x3 +3x2y + 3xy2 +y3
cube of the first term cube of the 
second term

76 77For free distribution For free distributionSimilarly, we can write (a + 2)3   =   a3 + 3a2 × 2 + 3 a × 22 + 23, and this can be further 
simplified as "

Now let us consider how the expansion of  (x – y)3 is obtained by taking products.
  (x – y)3 = (x – y) (x – y)2
                       
  
 = x3 – 2x2y + xy2 – x2y +2xy2 – y3
 = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 = (x – y)    (x2– 2xy +y2)
Now, let us consider how we can obtain the expansion of ( x – y)3, using another 
method.
First, note that we can write x – y as x +  (– y)' Therefore, we can treat ( x – y)3 as 
an expression of the initial form, by writing it as { x + (– y)}3' Let us now consider 
the expansion of this cube. 
(x – y)3 = {x + (– y)}3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × (– y) + 3 × x × (– y)2 + (– y)3
                       = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 
                                     
Note that we have used the properties (– y)2 = y 2  and  (– y)3 = – y 3 in the above 
simplification. 
 According to this, we can also write
 ( m – n)3 =  m3 – 3m2n + 3mn2 – n3 
 ( p – q)3 =  p3 – 3p2q + 3pq2 – q3 
 
Either method can be used to obtain the expansion of ( x – y)3.  You may use any 
method which is easy for you.
Let us now consider how the cube of a binomial expression, involving numbers as 
well, is expanded.

fractions are multiplied. Let us consider the following example.

single fraction.

If the terms in the numerator and the denominator can be further simplified, by 
doing the simplification we can  express the answer in the simplest form. These 
simplifications can be done either before multiplying the fractions or after 
multiplying the fractions. Let us now consider multiplying two fractions where 
such simplifications are possible.

Recall how you obtained the answer when dividing one fraction by another                 
fraction. You multiplied the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. 
Similarly, when dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction, we can 
instead multiply the first by the reciprocal of the second.
Before we study how algebraic fractions are divided, let us consider the reciprocal 
of an algebraic fraction.  
Reciprocal of an algebraic fraction
Recall the facts we have leaned regarding the reciprocal of a number. If the product 
of two numbers is 1, then each number is the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse 
of the other number. 
Because  2 ×  21=  1, reciprocal of  2 is  21 and reciprocal of  21 is 2.
Because  × 331 =  1,  reciprocal of 31 is 3 and reciprocal of 3  is 31. 
Because  ×    5445=  1,  reciprocal of   54  is 45 and reciprocal of   45 is 54. 
The reciprocal of an algebraic fraction is also described similarly. That is,
if the product of two algebraic fractions is 1, then each algebraic fraction is the 
reciprocal of the other. 
Let us multiply the two algebraic fractions x5 and 5x .
×x5 15x 1=  = 1.
Therefore, x5 is the reciprocal of  5x and 5x is the reciprocal of  x5 .
Similarly, because
 ×yy x + 1
x + 11=  ,
 yx + 1 is the reciprocal of   y
x + 1 and   y
x + 1 is the reciprocal of  yx + 1.
Now it should be clear that, the reciprocal of an algebraic fraction can be obtained 
84 85For free distribution For free distributionby simply interchanging the numerator and denominator, as you have done with

   identify the theorems on the relationships between the areas of triangles and 
parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines, 
and solve problems related to them.   
Introduction
You have already learnt about various plane figures and how the areas of certain 
special plane figures are found. Let us now recall how the areas of triangles and 
parallelograms are found.
When finding the areas of triangles and parallelograms, the terms altitude and base 
are used.  Let us first recall what these terms mean.
Let us consider the given triangle ABC  and the parallelogram PQRS .

C B D             P S
R QN
M
When finding the area of a triangle, any one of its sides can be considered as the 
base.  For example, the side BC of the triangle ABC can be considered as the base. 
Then AD is the corresponding altitude; that is, the perpendicular dropped from the 
vertex A to the side BC.
We know that,
area of triangle  ABC = 1
2  BC  AD. 
Similarly, if we consider the side AB to be the base, the corresponding altitude is 
CE. Accordingly, we can also write,  
area of triangle ABC = 1
2  AB  CE. 
We can similarly find the area of the triangle ABC  by taking AC as the base and 
drawing the corresponding altitude from the vertex B.Areas of Plane Figures 
between Parallel Lines 8
88 89For free distribution For free distributionNow let us consider the parallelogram PQRS .  Here too, the area can be found by 
considering any one of the sides as the base. If we consider the side QR as the base, 
the corresponding altitude is the line segment PM. The length of PM is the distance 
between the two parallel straight line segments QR and PS, the side opposite QR.
We know that,
the area of parallelogram PQRS = QR  PM. 
Similarly, if we consider the side PQ as the base, the corresponding altitude is RN. 
Therefore we can also write,
the area of parallelogram  PQRS  = PQ  RN.
Note
The length of the altitude of a triangle or a parallelogram is also often called the 
altitude. 
To recall what has been learnt earlier regarding finding the areas of parallelograms

   Both the parallelograms ABCD  and ABEF  in figure (i) lie between the pair of 
straight lines AB and DE. What is meant here by the word “between” is that a pair 
of opposite sides of each of the parallelograms lies on the straight lines  AB and 
DE. Further, the side AB is common to both parallelograms. In such a situation, 
we say that the two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same 
pair of parallel lines. Here, the common side AB has been considered as the base. 
It is clear that corresponding to this common base, both the parallelograms have 
the same altitude. This is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two 
parallel lines AB and DE. 
     Figure (ii) depicts a parallelogram and a triangle which lie on the same base and 
between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC. The parallelogram is ABCD 
and the triangle is ABE. The common base is AB. Observe that in this case, one 
side of the triangle and the opposite vertex lies on each parallel straight lines.

the same pair of parallel lines
Next we look at the relationship between the areas of parallelograms on the 
same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Consider the given                      
parallelograms . 
              DE
B AC F
P
Let us see whether the areas of the parallelograms ABCD  and ABEF  are equal.
Observe that,
area of parallelogram ABCD  = area of trapezium ABCF  + area of triangle AFD
area of parallelogram ABEF  = area of trapezium ABCF  +  area of triangle BEC
Therefore it is clear that, if 
the area of triangle AFD  = the area of triangle BEC , 
then the areas of the two parallelograms will be equal.
In fact, these two triangles are congruent. Therefore their areas are equal. The 
congruence of the two triangles under the conditions of SAS can be shown as 
follows. 
In the two triangles AFD  and BEC ,
 AD = BC  (opposite sides of a parallelogram)
 AF = BE       (opposite sides of a parallelogram)
Also, since  DAB
> = CBP
> (corresponding angles) and FA B
> = EBP
> (corresponding 
angles), by subtracting these equations we obtain
 DAF
> = CBE
>.
Accordingly, the two triangles AFD  and BEC  are congruent under the conditions 
of SAS.
Therefore we obtain,
area of parallelogram ABCD  = area of parallelogram ABEF .
We can write this as a theorem as follows.
92 93For free distribution For free distributionTheorem:  Parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel 
lines are equal in area.
Now let us obtain an important result using this theorem. You have used the 
following formula when finding the area of a parallelogram in previous grades and 
in the above exercise.
 Area of a parallelogram = Base  Perpendicular height
Have you ever thought about how this result was obtained? We can now use the 
above theorem to prove this result.
The figure depicts a rectangle ABCD  (that is, a parallelogram) and a parallelogram 
ABEF  on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. According to 
the above theorem, their areas are equal. 
  D F C E
A B
We know that,
area of the parallelogram ABEF   =  Area of the rectangle ABCD

 = AB  perpendicular distance between the 
     two parallel lines

Let us now consider how calculations are done using this theorem.

the same pair of parallel lines.
  (ii)  What is the area of the parallelogram ABCD ?
 (iii)  Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines AB and FC.
Now let us answer these questions.   
   (i) ABEF  and ABCD.
  (ii) Since the parallelograms  ABEF  and ABCD  lie on the same base AB and between 
the same pair of parallel lines AB and FC, their areas are equal. Therefore, the 
area of ABCD  = 80 cm2.
(iii) Let us take the perpendicular distance between the pair of parallel lines as              
h centimetres.  
Then,
 area of ABEF = AB  h.
                       80 = 8   h
                   ... h = 10
     ... the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines is 10 cm.
Now, by considering an example, let us see how riders are proved using this theorem.

 ^i& In the quadrilateral ABQD

Since a quadrilateral with pairs of opposite sides parallel, is a parallelogram, ABQD 
is a parallelogram. Similarly, since AB // PC  and AP // BC , we obtain that ABCP is 
a parallelogram. 
94 95For free distribution For free distribution ^ii&  Since the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP lie on the same base  AB and 
between the same pair of parallel lines  AB and DC, by the above theorem, 
their areas are equal.
      ...  area of parallelogram  ABQD = area of parallelogram ABCP .

>  (since SP // AD, corresponding angles)  
                 SCP  = RQD>

  (since SC // RQ, corresponding angles)
         Further,  AB = PC (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABCP )
AB = DQ (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABQD )                    
     Therefore,  PC = DQ.
...   SPC     RDQ. (AAS)
               
^iv& Area of parallelogram  ABQD = area of parallelogram  ABCP  (proved)  
 Area of    RDQ  = area of   SPC (since  RDQ    SPC)
Therefore, 
 area of  ABQD  – area of ∆ RDQ  = area of ABCP  – area of ∆ SPC.
Then, according to the figure,  
area of trapezium ABQR  = area of trapezium ABSP .
Therefore,
by subtracting the area of the triangle ABX from both sides, we get
 area of trapezium 
ABQR    =   area of trapezium    
     ABSP      – area of  ABX    –  area of    ABX
 ... area of parallelogram AXQR = area of parallelogram  BXPS.

96 97For free distribution For free distribution8.3 The areas of parallelograms and triangles on the same base

You have used the following formula in previous grades to find the area of a triangle.
 Area of the triangle = 1

Now we will explain why this formula is valid.
Let us consider the following triangle ABC .
   C
B A
Now let us draw a line parallel to AB through the point C, as shown in the figure, 
and mark the point D on this line such that ABDC  is a parallelogram. In other words 
let us mark the intersection point of the line drawn through B parallel to AC and the 
line drawn through C parallel to AB, as D.
   
AC D
B
The area of the triangle ABC  is exactly half the area of the parallelogram ABDC . 
This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two 
congruent triangles. We learnt this in the lesson on parallelograms in Grade 10.
Therefore,
area of triangle ABC   = 1
2 the area of parallelogram ABDC
                                   =  1
2   AB  perpendicular distance between AB and CD
             
             =  1

We have obtained the familiar formula for the area of a triangle.
96 97For free distribution For free distributionConsider again the result that we observed here;
area of triangle ABC  = 1
2 the area of parallelogram ABDC .
In section 8.2 of this lesson, we learnt that the areas of parallelograms on the same 
base and between the same pair of parallel lines are equal. Therefore, in relation to 
the above figure, the area of any parallelogram that lies on the same base AB and 
between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD is equal to the area of ABDC .
Therefore,
area of triangle  ABC = 1
2  (area of any parallelogram with base AB lying between 
the parallel lines AB and CD).
This result is given below as a theorem.
Theorem:  If a triangle and a parallelogram lie on the same base and between the 
same pair of parallel lines, then the area of the triangle is exactly half 
the area of the parallelogram.

C Q R DP T S U B
As discussed in section 8.3 the parallelogram related to the triangle  PQR is PQRS , 
and the parallelogram related to the triangle  TQR is TQRU.
Since the parallelogram related to the triangle  PQR is PQRS,
area of triangle PQR = 1
2 the area of parallelogram  PQRS.
Since the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU,
area of triangle  TQR = 1
2 the area of parallelogram  TQRU.

area of parallelogram PQRS = area of parallelogram  TQRU.
