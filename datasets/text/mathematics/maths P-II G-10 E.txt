3. Simplify each of the following expressions.
   
4. Simplify each of the following expressions and find its value.
19.1 Logarithms
Let us now consider how simplifications are facilitated by using the properties of 
indices. To do this, let us use the table of powers of 2 given below. 
Power of 2 2x212223242526272829210
Value 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
Let us consider how the value of  is found using this table.
First, let us write these numbers as powers of the same base.          
               
3 For free distributionIt can be seen that the above simplification was done easily and concisely by using 
the laws of indices. In the above example it was possible to write the numbers as powers of 2.  Any expression containing the multiplication and division of numbers can easily be simplified using the logarithm tables.  John Napier (1550 A.D. -1617 A.D.) a Scottish mathematician is bestowed with the honour of introducing the logarithm tables first. Briggs another mathematician who was a contemporary of Napier developed logarithms further. Although the use of the logarithm tables has reduced in recent years due to the widespread use of calculators, it is very important to learn the mathematical concepts related to logarithms.
Index form and logarithm form
We know that 23 = 8. Here 8 is expressed as a power with base 2 and index 3. 
Such expressions are defined as '' index form''. This can also be expressed as the logarithm of 8 to base 2 is 3. This is written as log
28 = 3, which is defined as the 
''logarithm form''. It must be clear to you that the same statement is written in index form and in logarithm form.
Accordingly, since 2
3 = 8, we also have log2 8 = 3.  
Similarly, log2 8 = 3, means 23 = 8. 
Let us consider several other examples.
• Since 32 = 9, the logarithm of 9 to base 3 is 2.  That is, log3 9 = 2.
• Since 51 = 5, the logarithm of 5 to base 5 is 1.  That is, log5 5 = 1.
• Since103 = 1000, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3.  That is, log10 1000 = 3.
In general, for a positive number a, 
If ax = N,  then logaN = x        If logaN = x, then ax = N
ax = N  is considered as the index form and loga N = x is considered as the logarithm 
form. Here a and N take only positive values. (Since any power of a positive number is positive, in the above relationship, when a is positive,  N is also positive.) 
Accordingly, when considering logarithms, the base always takes  a positive value.
Let us now identify several properties of logarithms.
(i) For any base, the logarithm of the base value itself is 1.  
That is,    log
aa = 1.
This is because   a1 = a. 
For example,  log2 2 = 1 and log10 10 = 1' 
(ii) The logarithm of 1 to any base (other than 1) is 0.
That is,     loga1 = 0.
This is because a0 = 1.  
For example,  log21 = 0 and log101 = 0' 
4For free distributionWe observe that so far we have obtained positive values for the logarithms. 
However, logarithms can also be negative. The logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is always negative.For example, 
0.01  
Now let us consider how equations involving logarithms are solved.
Example 1
Find the value represented by x in each of the following. 
(i) log264 = x  (ii) logx81 = 4  (iii) log5x = 2

(iii) The logarithm of x to base 2 is y.
(iv) The logarithm of q to base p is r.
  (v) The logarithm of r to base q is p.

(vii) log3x = 2 (viii) log10x = 4             (ix) log8x = 2
5. (i) Write 64 as a power of four different bases.     (ii) Find four distinct pairs of values for x and y such that log
x 64 = y.   
19.2 Laws of logarithms  
Let us recall again how the value of 16 × 32 can be obtained by writing it in index form.
16 « 32 = 2
4 « 25
   = 24 + 5
   = 29  
Let us now consider  16 « 32  = 24 + 5. 
Let us convert this to logarithm form.                             16 « 32 = 2
4 + 5   (Index form)
             log2^16 « 32& = 4 + 5  (Logarithm form)
= log216 ¬ log232  (Since 4 = log216 and 5 = log232)
Similarly, since     27 « 81 = 33 « 34 = 33 + 4,
                     log3^27 « 81& = 3 + 4'= log
327 ¬ log381 (Since 3 = log327 and 4 = log381)
In the same manner we can write,        log
10^10 « 100& = log1010 ¬ log10100 and
     log5^125 « 25& = log5125 ¬ log525' 
As seen above, when multiplying powers, an important fact about the behaviour of logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any product of powers and is expressed as follows.
   
loga(mn) = logam + logan
6For free distributionThis statement can also be expressed as “the logarithm of a product is equal to the 
sum of the logarithms”.Such a formula exists for the logarithm of a quotient too. Let us investigate this now.Let us consider the following example.Let us recall how the value of 128 ÷ 16 is obtained by converting it into index form.
Similarly,  
         and                                                               .
As seen above, when dividing powers, an important fact about the behaviour of 
logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any quotient of powers and is expressed as follows.
  
These properties are called ''Laws of Logarithms.''Now let us learn how to solve problems using these laws of logarithms by considering the following examples.

Logarithms Table
Let us recall several facts we have learnt earlier regarding logarithms.
Since 10o = 1, we obtain log10 1 = 0.  That is, the logarithm of 1 to base 10 is 0.
Since 101 = 10, we obtain log10 10  = 1. That is, the logarithm of 10 to base 10 is 1.
Since 102 = 100, we obtain log10 100 = 2.  That is, the logarithm of 100 to base 10 
is 2.Since 10
3 = 1000, we obtain log10 1000 = 3. That is, the logarithm of 1000 to base 
10 is 3.The following table has been prepared accordingly.
Number   1 10 100 1 000 10 000
Logarithm to base 10   0  1   2    3     4
This table provides the logarithm of the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 to base ten. Logarithm values exist for numbers between 0 and 1, between 1 and 10, between 10 and 100 etc also. These values are not whole numbers. The Scottish mathematician Henry Briggs who lived about four centuries ago prepared the logarithms table by calculating these values. He included only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10.  Below is given part of this logarithms table.

11 For free distributionThe numbers represented in the leftmost column under N by 10, 11, 12, …, 99 are 
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, … , 9.9 which are from 1 up to 10.  The decimal point (.) which should be placed in these numbers has not been indicated in the logarithms table. (This has been done to simplify the table). However, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct position. In the uppermost row, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,  …, 9 have been written from left to right, and in the same row, on the right, the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 9 have been written under the mean difference.
As an example the 29
th row of the table is given below. In this row, the value in the 
6th column is 4713. As mentioned earlier, the decimal point of the numbers is not 
written. But, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct 
position. That is, the value is 0.4713. 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9
29 4624 4639 4654 4669 4683 4698 4713 4728 4742 4757 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 11 12
This means that, the logarithm of 2.96 to base 10 is 0.4713. This also means  that 10
0.4713 = 2.96. That is, when 2.96 is written as a power of ten it is 100.4713. Using the 
logarithms table we can find the logarithm of numbers consisting of up to 4 digits.When writing logarithms to base 10, instead of writing log
10 we write lg in short.
Example: log10 100 = 2 is written as lg 100 = 2.
Note that to find the logarithm of 2.9, it must be written as 2.90. The value corresponding to the 29
th row and the column indicated by 0 must be taken as the 
logarithm of 2.90; that is 0.4624.This is written as, log 
10 2.9 = 0.4624 or lg 2.9 = 0.4624.
Writing this in index form we obtain 2.9 = 10 0.4624.
Note: Here the logarithm of a number is an approximate value.
20.1 The logarithm of a number with up to two decimal places 
lying between 1 and 10  
Let us identify how lg 4.58 is obtained using the logarithms table. The value that belongs to the row containing 45 which are the first two digits of 4.58 and the column containing 8, which is the remaining digit, is 0.6609. This value is the required logarithm. That is, the logarithm of 4.58  = lg 4.58 = 0.6609Writing this in index form we obtain 4.58 = 10
0.6609.

20.2 The logarithm of a number with up to three decimal places 
lying between 1 and 10  
We now know how to obtain the logarithm of a number with up to two decimal places which lies between 1 and 10. Next let us consider how the logarithm of a number with three decimal places which lies between 1 and 10 is found.
Let us identify how the logarithm of 5.075 which is a number with three decimal 
places is found using the table.  The number 7050 is obtained from the table as the value which belongs to the row containing 50, which are the first two digits of 5.075, and the column containing 7 which is the third digit of this number.  The mean difference in the same row, under the column containing 5, which is the fourth digit of 5.075 is 4.

Now add 4 to 7050.  Then since 7050 + 4 = 7054, we obtain lg 5.075 = 0.7054.
The index form of this is 5.075 = 100.7054.

20.3 The logarithm of numbers which are greater than 10          
Although only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10 are included in the 
logarithms table, the logarithm of any other number (up to four digits or rounded off up to four digits) can also be found using the table. Now let us consider the strategy that is used in such a case.
Example 1
Find the logarithm of 54.37Method (i):  lg  54'37 = lg (5'437 × 10
1)   (Representing in scientific notation)
   = lg 5'437 + lg 101  (Applying the laws of logarithms)
     = 0'7354 + 1 (From the logarithms table and since lg 10 = 1)
   = 1'7354                                
Method (ii):   Using indices    54'37 = 5'437 × 10
1
   =  100'7354  × 101 (Writing the value that is obtained from the   
     table 0.7354 as an index of 10)
   = 101'7354
                    lg  54'37 =  1'7354
Example 2
Find the logarithm of each of the following numbers.
  (i) 8'583                     (ii) 85'83                     (iii) 858'3        (iv) 8583
  (i)    lg 8'583 = lg  ^ 8'583  «  100 & = lg 8.583 + lg 100 = 0'9337 + 0 = 0'9337 
 (ii)   lg 85'83 = lg  ^ 8'583 «  101 & = lg 8.583 + lg 101 = 0'9337 + 1 = 1'9337 
(iii)  lg 858'3 = lg  ^ 8'583  «  102 & = lg 8.583 + lg 102 = 0'9337 + 2 = 2'9337 
(iv)      lg 8583 = lg ^ 8'583  « 103 & = lg 8.583 + lg 103 = 0'9337 + 3 = 3'9337 
14 For free distribution(The decimal part of these logarithms remains the same since what is obtained from 
the table in each instance is the value in the 85th row, the 8th column and the 3rd mean 
difference column).  
In the logarithm 1.9337 of 85.83 in the above example, the decimal part of the 
logarithm is called the mantissa and the whole number 1 which is on the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic  of the logarithm.
Observe the following table.

digits in the integral part Scientific

     1     2
According to the table, the characteristic of the logarithm of a number is the index of the power of ten, in the expression obtained when the number is expressed in scientific notation.For numbers which are larger than 1, the characteristic of the logarithm is one less than the number of digits in the integral part of the number.  Accordingly, for numbers such as 5.673 which have just one digit in the integral part, the characteristic is 0.

15 For free distribution20.4 Antilogarithm
According to the logarithms table, lg 59.3 = 1.7731. That is, the logarithm of 59.3 is 
1.7731 . Another way of saying this is that 1.7731 is the logarithm of 59.3. Then we say that the antilogarithm of 1.7731 is 59.3. We write this as antilog 1.7731 = 59.3.
Now let us consider how the antilogarithm is obtained when the mean difference 
section is also involved.
Example 1
Find antilog 0.8436 using the logarithms table.
Mean difference
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9
8432 4 69                                                                          
antilog 0.8436 = 6.976We can describe how the antilogarithm of 0.8436 was found using the above table as follows. Since this value is not in the table, we consider the number in the table which is less than this and closest to it.  This value is 8432 which lies in the 69
th row 
and 7th column. The difference 4 (= 8436 – 8432) is in the  6th column of the mean 
difference section.  Accordingly, the required antilogarithm is 6.976 .  (Since the characteristic of 0.8436 is 0 there is only one digit in the integral part of the antilog)
When the characteristic of the logarithm is 0, the antilogarithm can be written 
directly from the table as in the above example, as a number between 1 and 10. However when the characteristic is greater than 0, the antilog can be found as shown in the following example.
Example 2
Find the value of antilog 1.8436antilog 1.8436 = 6.976×10
1   (6.971 from the mantissa and  1 in 101 from the characteristic)

20.5 Multiplying and dividing numbers greater than 1 using the 
logarithms table   
We know the two laws of logarithms  lg ^MN& = lg M + lg N and M
N = lg M – lg N.
Now let us see how numbers can be multiplied and divided using the knowledge 
gained on logarithms up to this point, and the above laws. 
Example 1
Evaluate using the logarithms table.^i& 4.975 × 10.31     ^ii& 53.21 ÷ 4.97
Let us take P = 4.975 × 10.31                 
Then,  lg P = lg (4.975 × 10.31)                   
  = lg 4.975 + lg 10.31   (Logarithm laws)                        
  = 0.6968 + 1.0132      (From the logarithms table)                  
         = 1.7100
          
 P = antilog 1.7100
    = 51.28
4.975 × 10.31 = 51.28 
    
This product can also be obtained using the index laws
4.975 × 10.31 = 100.6968 × 101.0132     (From the logarithms table)
        = 101.7100                     (Sum of the indices)

                             =  5.128  « 101        (Antilog of 0.7100 using the tables)

                  10.71Let us take P = 53.21 ÷ 4.97                
Then    lg P = lg (53.21 ÷ 4.97)                        
  = lg 53.21 – lg 4.97                                 = 1.7260 – 0.6964                                      = 1.0296

2.	Here	 a	is	a	non-zero	number.	Here	 y	is	defined	as	the	function.	 y	can	be	
considered	as	a	function	which	is	determined	by	 ax2.
First	let	us	draw	the	graph	of	 y = x2.
To	do	this,	let	us	proceed	according	to	the	following	steps.
Step 1Preparing	a	table	of	values	to	find	the	 y	values	corresponding	to	given	 x	values	of

27 For free distributionThe	maximum	value	that	the	 x	coordinate	takes	in	the	pairs	that	were	obtained	is	+3	
and	the	minimum	value	is	 –3.	The	maximum	value	that	the	 y	coordinate	takes	is	9	
and	the	minimum	value	is	0.	
Let	us	draw	the	 x	and	y	axes	according	to	a	suitable	scale,	on	the	piece	of	paper	that	
is	to	be	used	to	draw	the	graph,	so	that	the	 x	-	axis	can	be	calibrated	from		 –3	to	3	
and	the	y	-	axis	can	be	calibrated	from	0	to	9.
Step 3
Drawing	the	graph	of	the	function.Let	us	mark	the	seven	points	on	the	coordinate	plane	that	has	been	prepared.Next	let	us	join	the	points	that	have	been	marked	so	that	a	smooth	curve	is	obtained.	This	smooth	curve	is	the	graph	of	the	function	 y = x

By studying this lesson you will be able to • solve problems related to distance, time and speed • represent information related to distance and time graphically • solve problems related to liquid volumes, time and rate.
 22.1 Speed
10 m A B
Let us assume that a battery operated toy car takes 5 seconds to travel from point A 
to point B which is 10 m away.
Then the distance that the car has travelled during 5 seconds is 10 m. If the distance that the car moves forward during each second is the same from the moment it 
starts, then the distance it travels during each second is 
metres, that is, 2 metres.  
Accordingly, as the car moves forward from A, the rate at which the distance 
changes with respect to time is 2 metres per second.  We can define this value as the 
speed with which the car travels from A to B.
If the distance travelled by an object in motion is a constant per unit of time, then the object is said to be travelling with uniform speed.  Further, the speed of the object is then the distance travelled per unit of time. From this point on, only objects which travel with uniform speed will be considered in this lesson.
However, in reality, vehicles that travel on the main road are usually unable to 
maintain a uniform speed throughout the whole journey due to the traffic on the road and various other reasons. The instrument called the speedometer gives the speed of a vehicle at any given instance.
The speed denoted by the speedometer in the figure can be written as 80 kmph. It can also be written as  80 km /h or 
as 80 kmh
–1.
         Rate 22
44 For free distributionAs you travel along a main road, you may observe road signs with 40 kmph and 60 
kmph written on them to indicate speed limits. Try to recall that heavy vehicles such as lorries carry a board at the back with  40 kmph written on it.
For an object that is moving with uniform speed, the relationship between the three quantities, namely the distance travelled, the time taken and the speed can be written as follows.            
   
Speed =Distance travelled
Time taken
This relationship can also be written in the following simple form (without fractions).
    
             Distance = Speed  « Time
Example 1
A feather floating on air with uniform speed, drifts 100 m in 20 seconds. Calculate 
the speed with which the feather drifts.
Speed with which it drifts  = Distance it drifts

Example 4
How far does a motorcycle travel along a main road in 5 seconds, if its speedometer displays a constant speed of 36  kmh
–1  during this period?
Here, the speed has been given in kilometres per hour.  Let us convert it to metres per second.  
Since the speed is 36 kmh
–1,
            distance travelled during an hour  =  36 km
      =  36 « 1000 m
                      However,  1 hour = 60 « 60 seconds
 Distance travelled in  60 « 60 seconds =  36 « 1000 m
           Distance travelled in 1 second = 
      
 Distance travelled by the motorcycle in one second = 10 m 
                   Distance travelled in 5 seconds    = 10 « 5 m
                = 50 m

at a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1?
75 m

When it passes the signpost
 When it reaches the signpost
The distance travelled by the train as it passes the signpost = 75 mFirst, let us find the speed in terms of metres per second.
46 For free distribution            The speed of the train is 60  kmh-1.
    . .. Distance travelled in one hour =  60 km
           Distance travelled in one hour  =  
        Distance travelled in one second = 
      = 
                  Speed of the train   =  s
         Since time  =distance
 speed, 
      time taken by the train to pass the signpost = 75 ÷  seconds
       
       = 75 ×   seconds
                  = 4.5 seconds
Example 6

            72 kmh
–1 =  ms–1
          = 20 ms–1
 The total distance travelled in crossing the bridge  = 100 m + 60 m
          = 160 m
              Distance travelled by the train in 1 second = 20 m                               That is, time taken to travel 20 m  = 1 second

A vehicle travelling along a main road is usually unable to maintain the same speed 
throughout the journey. The concept of average speed is important in such situations. The value obtained when the total distance travelled by an object is divided by the total time taken is called the average speed.

in motion, with respect to time. In such a graph, the x axis represents the time 
and the y axis represents the distance travelled. A graph of this form is called a                 distance-time graph.
A table prepared with the information collected by observing the motion of a 
satellite travelling with uniform speed is given below.

The speed of the satellite can be calculated by dividing the total distance travelled 
by the total time taken. 
               Speed of the satellite   
Since the satellite is travelling with uniform speed, the speed can also be obtained 
by considering the distance travelled per unit of time.
Accordingly, you can observe that the gradient of the graph and the speed of the 
satellite are equal. Therefore, for an object moving with uniform speed, a straight line is obtained as the distance-time graph, and the speed of the object can be obtained from the gradient of this line.
       
Gradient of the distance-time graph = Speed of the object in motion

house and then returned back home after spending some time with his friend is given below.   (i) Calculate the speed at which Nimal cycled to his friend’s house.  (ii) Calculate the speed at which Nimal returned home.

52 For free distribution 22.3 Volume and Time
We defined speed as the distance travelled per unit of time. Another way of saying 
this is that speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. This idea of rate can also be used to describe various other processes that we come across in day to day life. Let us consider the example of water flowing out of a tap. If we collect the water that flows out from a tap during periods of one second each, and if by measuring we discover that the volume of water that flows out during each second is a constant, then we say that the water flows out at a uniform rate. Further, we call this constant value the rate at which water flows out from the tap.
When time is measured in seconds and the volume of water is measured in litres, 
the unit of the rate of flow is litres per second  ( ls
-1).
Suppose it takes 20 minutes for a tank of capacity 1000 l to be filled completely using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate.
Then, the volume of water that flowed out of the pipe during 20 minutes 
 
      The amount of water that flowed out during 1 minute    
Accordingly, the amount of water that flows out of the pipe per unit of time, that is, 
during one minute, is 50 litres. Therefore, we can express the rate at which water flows out of the pipe as 50 litres per minute.
     Change of volumeRate of change of volume   =
              Time
          
This can also be represented as follows.
            Change of volume = Rate of change of volume  × Time

If the values of all the unknowns in a formula except for one are given, then by 
substituting these values in the formula, the value of the remaining unknown can be found.Given below is the formula for the volume (v) of a cone, in terms of its radius (r) and its height ( h).
    
Find the value of r when v = 132 and h = 14'                   
Let us first make r the subject of the formula.
To solve this problem, it is not necessary to first make r the subject of the formula.  (since r is positive)

However, there are many benefits of knowing how to change the subject of a

For example, when it is required to find the base radius of several cones of different volumes, if r is made the subject of the above formula for the volume of a cone, then it will be very easy to perform the required calculations to find the different radii.Also, it is necessary to change the subject of the formula if these calculations are being done using a calculator or a computer.

   recognize arithmetic progressions and solve problems related to arithmetic    progressions. 
In earlier grades, you have learned various number patterns. A number pattern 
when indicated as a list is called a sequence of numbers or simply a sequence. Let us consider the following sequence.
3, 8, 13, 18, ....
In this sequence, the first term is 3, the second term is 8, the third term is 13 etc. A feature of this sequence is that, considering any two consecutive terms in the sequence, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is 5.A similar sequence is shown below.
8, 5, 2, –1" –4, '''
In this sequence too, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, for any pair of consecutive terms, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is –3. 
Sequences having this feature are called arithmetic progressions. The constant 
value obtained by subtracting any term from the term right after that term is called the common difference, and is usually denoted by d. 
   An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that a constant value is obtained when any term is subtracted from the term right after that term.
The common difference d, of an arithmetic progression can be found as follows:

1. Determine whether each of the following sequences is an arithmetic progression.
2. Find the common difference of each of the following arithmetic progressions.
 24.1 nth term of an Arithmetic Progression
The following notation is used to denote the terms of an arithmetic progression.
T1= 1st term      
T2= 2nd term   
T3= 3rd term etc.
For example, for the arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,...
we may write  T1= 6" T2= 8, T3= 10, T4= 12, T5= 14 etc  .
What is the 25th term of this progression? In other words, what is the value of T25? 
It is clear that if you continue writing the terms according to the above pattern, the 
25th term appears when you write 25 terms. If you do this, you will get 54 as the 25th
term. That is, T25 = 54.
Now, if you require to find the 500th term of this progression, how would you find 
it? For this you would have to write down 500 terms following the pattern, which is quite a tedious task. Let us see how we can derive a formula that can be used to 
63 For free distributionfind any term of an arithmetic progression rather easily.
Let us illustrate this derivation using the above arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, ... For this progression, the first term is 6 and the common difference is 2. Observe carefully how the terms of this progression have been written in terms of the first term and the common difference in the following table.

Now, according to the pattern in the table, 
T
500 = 6 + (500 – 1) × 2
        = 6 + 499 × 2
        = 6 + 998        = 1004 Hence, the 500
th term is 1004. 
Can you generalize the above pattern further? In other words, can you find a formula for the n
th term Tn in terms of the first term a and the common difference d?  For 
this, look at the expression T500 = 6 + (500 – 1) × 2 again, where 6 is the 1st term and 
2 is the common difference.
You can see that if you follow the above pattern to obtain the nth term Tn of the 
arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d, you obtain
Tn = a + (n – 1) d. In this formula, according to our notation, Tn denotes the nth term. 
Hence, the nth term Tn  of the arithmetic progression with first term a and common 
difference d is given by
Tn = a + (n – 1) d  
The importance of this formula is that it gives the relationship between the four unknowns a, d, n and T
n. This formula can be used to find the value of any one 
of the four  unknowns when the values of the other 3 unknowns in an arithmetic progression are known.
Now let us consider how problems on arithmetic progressions are solved using this 
formula.

Find the 15th term of the arithmetic progression 3, 7, 11, 15....
Here, a = 3, d = 7 – 3 = 4, n = 15. Substitute these values in Tn = a + (n – 1)d to get
    T15 = 3 + (15 – 1) × 4
  = 3 + 56  = 59Therefore the 15
th term is 59.
Example 2   (Finding a when d, n and Tn are known)
Find the first term of the arithmetic progression with common difference 4 and 26th
term equal to 105.Here, d = 4  and  T
n = 105 when n = 26.
Substituting these in Tn  = a + (n – 1) d  we get,
T26 = a + (26 – 1) × 4
              105 = a + (26 – 1) × 4
 105 – 100  = a 
     a = 5
Therefore the first term is 5.
Example 3   (Finding d when a, n and Tn are known)
Find the common difference of the arithmetic progression with 1st term –  32 and 
12th term 1. 
Here,  a = –32 and  Tn  =  1 when n = 12
Substituting these in    Tn    = a + (n – 1) d,  we get 
   1    = –32 + (12 – 1) × d 
            33  = 11  × d 
             = d
  
              d  = 3                        
Therefore  the common difference is 3.

Here,       a = 30" d = – 5" Tn = – 65

         – 65 = 30 × (n – 1) × (– 5)             – 65 = 30 – 5n + 5     – 65 – 35 =  –5n

  n = 20.     – 65 is the 20th term
For an arithmetic progression, when the values of 2 unknowns out of a, d, n and 
Tn are not given, the values of these two unknowns can be found by solving two 
simultaneous equations, when sufficient information has been provided.
Example 5  
The 7th and 12th terms of an arithmetic progression are 38 and 63 respectively.
Find,  (i) the first term and the common difference
         (ii) the 20th term.
(i) Since Tn = 38 when n = 7 and Tn = 63 when n = 12 , we get, by substituting in 
     Tn = a + (n – 1) d,
       
 T7= a + (7 – 1) × d   T12 = a + (12 – 1) × d
38 = a + 6d       1  63 = a + 11 d        2
Now, let us solve      1 and       2
     2 –      1 gives
  63 – 38 = a + 11 d – (a + 6d)
            25 = a + 11 d – a – 6d
         25 = 5d
         5 = d
Substitute d = 5" in      1 to get
            38 = a + 6 × 5
  38 – 30 = a
           a = 8
 the first term is 8 and the common difference is 5.
(ii) Now that we know the first term and the common difference of the 
           progression, let us substitute a = 8, d = 5  and n = 20 in Tn   = a + (n – 1) d.
         T20     = 8 + (20 – 1)  × 5
                 = 8 + 19 × 5                 = 8 + 95                 = 103

In a certain sequence, the nth term Tn is given by Tn = 3n + 4.
(i)  Write down the first 4 terms of this sequence.
(ii)  Write down an expression for the ( n – 1)th term of this sequence and hence 
       show that this is an arithmetic progression.(iii) Which term is 169 in this arithmetic progression?
66 For free distribution(iv) Show that no term in this progression is equal to 95.
(i) We have  Tn = 3n + 4.     
  When n = 1, T1 = 3 × 1 + 4 = 7               
When n = 2, T2 = 3 × 2 + 4 = 10                                    
When n = 3, T3 = 3 × 3 + 4 = 13  
When n = 4, T4 = 3 × 4 + 4 = 16                  
 the first four terms are 7" 10" 13 and 16" respectively '          
(ii) Replacing n by n – 1 in Tn  = 3n + 4, we get 
      Tn – 1  = 3 (n – 1) + 4      
    = 3n – 3 + 4  
              = 3n + 1 
Tn– Tn – 1  = (3n + 4) – (3n + 1) 
              = 3
              = constant
 the sequence is an arithmetic progression.
          
(iii) It is given that Tn  = 169.                 
       Substituting in   Tn   = 3n + 4, we get              
       169 = 3n + 4  
169 – 4 =  3n                                 
      = n

 169 is the 55th term.  
(iv) If there is a term with value 95, then there should be a positive integer n
      such that Tn = 95.
Then, 95 = 3n + 4
     3n  = 95 – 4

24.2 Sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression
Consider the arithmetic progression 3" 5" 7" 9" 11" 13" 15" 17" ''' in which the first 
8 terms are written down. The sum of these 8 terms is
3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 80.
We denote by Sn the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression. In this 
notation, the sum of the first 8 terms of the above arithmetic progression can be written as 
S
8 =  3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17
S8 =  80
       
69 For free distributionWhen we have to find the sum of a large number of terms, this lengthy way of 
adding all the terms one by one is a tedious task. In order to overcome this problem, let us derive a formula that can be used to find the sum of the initial terms of an arithmetic progression.Considering the above example, we rewriteS
8 =  3 + 5 +  7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 1
and again by reversing the terms we write
S8 =  17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 2
Now from 1 and 2 we may write, rearranging the terms,
 2 S8 = (3 + 17) + (5 + 15) + (7 + 13) + (9 + 11) + (11 + 9) + (13 + 7) +  (15 + 5)  
           +  (17 + 3)
            2 S8 = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20
        2 S8 = 8 × 20    (there are 8 terms of 20)  
       S8    = 
                 = 80 
We may illustrate the above method as follows.  
 3 +  5  +   7  +   9  +  11  +  13  +  15  +  17
20
20
20
20
There are 8 terms in the progression.The first term and the last term add to 20.The second and the penultimate term add to 20.Continuing this, we see that the sum of the first 8 terms of the progression is a sum of 4 pairs.The number of such pairs is one half the total number of terms to be added.Then the sum of all the terms is the product,
 
(number of terms)(first term + last term)2
               S8  =   
Now, let us derive a formula using the above process, for the sum of the first n 
terms, Sn, of an arithmetic progression with first term a, common difference d and 
last (nth) term l. 
We may write,  
70 For free distributionSn = a + ( a + d )  + (  a + 2d ) + ( a + 3d ) + ... (  l – 2d ) + ( l – d ) + l    1
and then reversing the terms,
Sn = l + ( l – d ) + ( l – 2d ) + ( l – 3d ) + ... ( a + 2d ) + ( a + d ) + a     2
Now 1 and 2 gives 
            2 Sn     = ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ... ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l )
    2 Sn = n ( a + l )    [there are n number of a + l terms]
           . 
As an example, let us find using the above formula, the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. The relevant progression is 1" 2" 3" 4" '''98" 99" 100, where a = 1, l = 100 
and n = 100.  
       
    S100 =   
   
                        S100 = 50 (101)
         S100   = 5050'
        
 the sum of the integers from 1 to 100 is 5050.
The above formula can be used to find the sum of an arithmetic progression given 
the first term ( a), the number of terms ( n) and the last term ( l).
Now we derive a formula for the sum, given the first term (a), the number of terms (n) and the common difference ( d).
For this purpose, in the formula
                 
,
we substitute for l, which is actually Tn, the nth term given by Tn = a + (n – 1) d. we 
then get,
and this simplifies to
'"
Therefore, to find the sum Sn of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression with 
first term a and common difference d, use the formula 
 
71 For free distributionAs an example, let us find the sum of the first 30 terms of the arithmetic progression 
2, 4, 6, 8, ... In this progression, a = 2   d = 2 and n = 30.
 Substituting in  
we get
the sum of the first 30 terms is 930 .
In summary, we could use
³  when the first term, the number of terms and the last term are known
³  when the first term, the number of terms and the common  
difference are known
Let us look at some examples now.
Example 1  Find the sum of the first 12 terms of the arithmetic progression                
5, 10, 15, 20, ....
Here a = 5, d = 5 and n = 12. Substituting these in  ,we get,

term are 75 and 0 respectively. Find its sum if the common difference

Substituting in
the sum of the arithmetic progression is 600∴ ',

Here a = 70, l = 2, and d = – 4.First we have to find the number of terms in the progression. Using the formula    
we getnT " "
The progression has 18 terms and its sum can be found by using the formula 
the sum of the terms of the series is 648 .

of these unknowns are given, the remaining unknown can be found by using the 
formula. The case for the formula  is similar.

Grouped Data
Data collected through a survey on the number of family members that reside in 
each of the houses in a certain housing scheme is given below.    4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 3  8, 4, 5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5, 4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 5, 7  5, 5, 7, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4
The greatest value of this data set is 9 and the least value is 2. The value that is 
obtained when the least value is subtracted from the greatest value is defined as the range. 
   
  The range of the given data set  =  9 – 2
                       =  7When the range of a data set is small, as in the above case, the information related to the data can be tabulated as follows. A table of the following form is called a frequency distribution.

Let us consider another example.
Information on the marks obtained for mathematics at the term test by the grade 10 
students of a certain school is given below.  26

Accordingly, the range of the data set    = 94 – 8         = 86Since the range of this data set is large, if we tabulate this information under each value from 8 to 94, we will obtain a very long table.  
When the range of the data set is large, as in the above case, it is convenient to 
divide the data into groups and tabulate the information.  
Let us now see how a set of data is separated into groups (class intervals).A frequency distribution prepared by separating the above data into class intervals 
is given below.
Class Interval Frequency
 8 - 16
17 - 2526 - 34 35 - 4344 - 5253 - 6162 - 7071 - 7980 - 8889 - 973748567221
What is meant by stating that the frequency of the class interval 8 - 16 is 3, is that there are 3 values (data) that lie in the interval from 8 to 16.
The greatest frequency of this distribution is 8. It corresponds to the class interval 
35 - 43. This class interval is named the modal class.
A frequency distribution such as the above which is expressed using class intervals is called a grouped frequency distribution.
When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, the class intervals are formed so that there are about 10 class intervals.  
Observe that all the class intervals in this example are of the same size.That is, the size of each class interval is 9. 
89 For free distributionThe initial class interval of this distribution is 8 - 16, and the next class interval is  
17 -25. The relevant data are test marks. Since there are no marks between 16 and 17, the class intervals have been organized such that when the first class interval ends with 16, the next class interval starts with 17.  
Now let us consider how the mean of a grouped frequency distribution such as the 
above distribution is found. For this, the mid-value of each class interval has to be found first.
26.1 Mid-value of a class interval
Let us find the mid-value of the class interval 8 - 16 in the above example.
It can be found as follows;  ' 
Accordingly, the mid-value of the class interval 8 – 16 is 12.The mid-value of a class interval is found by adding together the upper value and the lower value of the class interval and then dividing this sum by 2.  The mid-value of every class interval can be found in this manner.
The mid-value of a class interval is considered as the representative value of the 
data in that class interval when calculations are performed.
Class Interval Mid-value Frequency

17 - 2526 - 3435 - 4344 - 5253 - 6162 - 7071 - 7980 - 8889 - 97122130394857667584933748567221
A grouped frequency distribution prepared with the data collected on the ages of the staff members in a certain office is given below.

Number of staff members 5 3 3 5 4 2 2 1
Let us recall how the class intervals were written in the example discussed earlier on the mathematics marks of the grade 10 students. The first class interval was writ -
ten as 8 – 16 and the second class interval was written as 17 – 25. Since there were no marks between 16 and 17, it was appropriate to separate the class intervals in this manner. However in this example, the first class interval is written as 20 – 25, and the second class interval is written as 25 – 30. That is, the second class interval starts with the same value that the first class interval ends. The reason for this is because the data collected here are the ages of people. Since there can be people whose ages lies between 25 and 26 years, the second class interval should com -
mence with the value with which the previous class interval ended. 
The ages 20 or greater but less than 25 belong to the class interval 20 – 25. 
Accordingly the age 25 years belongs to the class interval 25 – 30 years.
Data such as length, weight, etc,. Which can take any value within a range are 
called continuous data. Data such as no.of students, marks, etc,. Which take only integral values are called discrete data.
Given below is the grouped frequency distribution of the ages of the staff members, 
together with the mid-values of the class intervals.

26.2 Calculating the mean of grouped data
When calculating the mean of grouped data, the mid-value of a class interval is taken as the value which represents the whole class interval. Let us now consider how the mean of grouped data is calculated using the mid-values.
93 For free distributionExample 1

By using the above information, let us construct a table which contains a                           mid-value column and a column consisting of the product of the mid-values and the corresponding frequencies. Here x denotes the mid-value and f denotes the frequency.

Here, Σf denotes the total number of children,  fx denotes the product of the

the fx column.Then the mean is defined by    '
That is,

26.3 Calculating the mean using the assumed mean
The class intervals of a grouped frequency distribution may sometimes contain large mid-values. In such situations, finding the mean using the above method may not be easy. Let us consider a more suitable method of finding the mean of a distribution of this type, through an example. 
That is, by considering a simple example, let us explain how the mean is calculated 
using the assumed mean.
Example 1 
The following table contains data on the number of units of water that was consumed during a month by 70 families who receive water from a certain water scheme.
Class interval 12 - 14 15 - 17 18 - 20 21 - 23 24 - 26 27 - 29
Number of families 5 9 11 26 11 8
96 For free distributionCalculate the mean number of water units that was consumed by a family, to the 
nearest whole number.
Let us first find the mid-values which represent each of the class intervals.
Let us now assume that the mid-value 22 of the class interval 21 – 23 is the mean.  That is, let us take 22 to be the assumed mean.  Now let us find the deviation of each mid-value from the assumed mean by subtracting the assumed mean from each mid-value.
That is,  deviation  =  mid-value  –  assumed mean 
   
Let us now tabulate this information. We denote the deviation by d.

Here Σf denotes the total number of families , fd the product of the deviation and the 
corresponding frequency, and  Σfd the sum of the values in the fd column.
The mean is obtained by,
Mean = Assumed Mean + Mean of the Deviations 
        Accordingly, for the above example,  
Mean 
It is easy to find the deviations by taking the assumed mean to be either the                    mid-value of the modal class or the mid-value of the median class.
97 For free distributionIf the assumed mean is denoted by A and the deviations are denoted by d, then the 
mean of the frequency distribution is given by A  
That is" Actual mean A

A straight line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to a point on the circle 
is called a radius (Observe the above figure). The length of this line segment is the same irrespective of the point on the circumference that is selected. Therefore, such a line segment is called the radius of the circle. The length of the radius is also called the radius.
A straight line segment joining two points on a circle is defined as a  chord.
A chord which passes through the centre of the circle is called a diameter. All the 
diameters of a circle are equal in length. This length is also called the diameter.  A diameter is the longest chord of a circle. The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius.

• construct parallel lines• construct triangles with the given information.
 28.1 Construction of the basic loci
The path of a point in motion is defined as its locus. Several examples of loci that can be observed in our environment are given below.
1. The path of a fruit which falls from a tree.2. The path of the pointed end of a clock hand.3. The path of a planet orbiting around the sun.4. The path of a pendulum in a pendulum clock.5. The path of a ball that is hit by a bat.
In this lesson we will only be considering loci in a plane.Note: Before considering the construction of loci, direct your attention to the following facts.
1. Distance between two points:
Let us consider two points A and B that lie on a plane.  What is meant by the 
distance between the two points is the length of the straight line segment joining the two points.
                   
A B
2. Distance from a point to a straight line:
Let us consider a given point A and a given straight line. What is meant by the distance from A to the straight line is the shortest distance from A to the straight 
line. This shortest distance is the perpendicular distance from A to the straight line.

Consider the following two parallel lines. Let us consider any point A on one of the lines. The perpendicular distance from A to the other straight line is said to be the distance between the two lines. Since the two lines are parallel, irrespective of where the point A is located on the line, this distance remains the same.

567891011The pointed end of each hand on the clock face in the figure is 
always located at a constant distance from the centre of the clock, which is the location at which the hand is fixed to the clock. You will be able to observe when the clock is working, that the path of the pointed end of each hand is a circle. The point where the hands are fixed to the clock is the centre of these circles, and the radius of 
each circle is the length of the relevant hand. Observe here that the pointed end of each hand is travelling at a constant distance from a fixed point. That particular constant distance is the length of the hand.
The locus of a point moving at a constant distance from a fixed point is a circle. 
Let us see how a circle is constructed.Mark a point. Take the radius of the circle that you want to construct to the pair of compasses using the ruler and keep the point of the pair of compasses on the point you marked. Now draw the circle.

equal distance from the two points A and B. Further, Q is another point which is at an 
equal distance from A and B. There are a large number of points such as these, which are at an equal distance from A and B. 
Observe what is obtained when all these points are joined together.
116 For free distributionIt is clear that the straight line that is obtained when all these points are joined 
together, passes through the midpoint of the line joining A and B, and is perpendicular 
to AB.
The locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two fixed points is the perpendicular bisector of the straight line joining the two points.
Now let us consider how this locus, that is, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB is constructed.Mark two points and name them as A and B.

compasses, take a length which is a little more than half the length of AB, and taking A and 
B as the centres and the length on the pair of compasses as the radius, draw two arcs which intersect each other (as shown in the figure).

Step 2: Name the intersection points of the two arcs as

117 For free distributionAccordingly, the locus of a point which lies 2 cm from the straight line AB  is one 
of two straight lines which are parallel to AB and lie on opposite sides of AB 2 cm

a line parallel to the given straight line, at the given constant distance from the straight line, which may lie on either side of the straight line.
Now let us consider how a pair of lines parallel to a given straight line, which is the locus under consideration, is constructed.

128 For free distribution  Surface Area and Volume
By studying this lesson you will be able to
     • calculate the surface area and volume of a right circular cylinder     • calculate the surface area and volume of a right triangular prism
The Cylinder
   
The cross sections of the solids given above are uniform, and the plane surfaces at 
the two ends are parallel to each other.  Solids having such shapes are defined in general as cylinders.
Curved surface   
      Axis
GeneratorCircular plane 
surfacesThe cylinder in the figure has two 
circular plane surfaces at the top and the bottom. Apart from these, it also has a curved surface. The radii of the two circular plane surfaces are equal to each other. Therefore, the 
areas of these two plane surfaces are equal.  The straight line joining the centres of these two circles is called the axis of the cylinder. Any straight line on the curved surface which is parallel to the axis of the cylinder is called a generator of the cylinder.
The axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two circular plane surfaces.  
Therefore, such a cylinder is called a right circular cylinder . (There are cylinders 
which are not right circular.  However such cylinders will not be discussed here.)  What is meant by the term “right” is that the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two plane surfaces. What is meant by the term “circular” is that any cross section which is perpendicular to the axis is circular in shape.
The radius of a plane face of the cylinder is usually denoted by r and the length of 
the axis is usually denoted by h. The radius r of the circular faces is called the radius 
of the cylinder and the length of the axis h is called the height of the cylinder.29
129 For free distribution29.1 Surface area of a right circular cylinder
When the radius and the height of a cylinder are given, the areas of the three surface 
parts of the cylinder need to be added together to obtain the total surface area. The areas of the two circular faces at the two ends can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle. A mechanism such as the following can be used to calculate the area of the curved surface

When the curved surface of the cylinder is cut along a generator as shown in the figure and opened out, a rectangle is obtained. The length of one side of this 
rectangle is equal to the height (h) of the cylinder while the length of the other side is equal to the perimeter  of one of  its circular plane faces.
The area of this rectangle is equal to the area of the curved surface of the cylinder. 
Accordingly, an expression for the curved surface of the cylinder can be developed in the following manner.
r
Now we can find the total surface area of the cylinder in the following manner.         
Total surface area  = Area of top  + Area of bottom +  Area of curved
of the cylinder   face   face    surface

29.4 Volume of a prism
Let us consider how the volume of a prism with a triangular cross section which you identified in 28.2 above is found.
Al
Cross sectional areaHeight (length)We know that the volume of a right solid with a 
uniform cross section is equal to the product of the area of the cross section and the height (length).
We can use the above principle to find the volume 
of the right prism with a uniform triangular cross section given in the figure.
 
Then, 
Volume of the prism  Area of the cross section Perpendicular height (length)
Note: 
When the area A of the triangular cross section is not given directly, it is necessary 
to calculate it using the data related to the triangular cross section given in the problem.

We	know	that	we	will	get	either	heads	or	tails	when	we	toss	a	coin.	This	observation	
is an example of a random experiment. The possible results are either 'heads' or'tails'.	However	we	cannot	say	with	certainty	what	the	outcome	will	be	before	observing	it.	Experiments	in	which	we	know	the	possible	outcomes,	but	cannot	say	with	certainty	which	outcome	will	occur	are	called	 random experiments .	The	
set	to	which	all	the	possible	outcomes	of	a	random	experiment	belong	is	called	'the	samplespace'.Itisdenotedby S.
The	following	table	shows	some	examples	for	random	experiments	and	the	relevant	sample	spaces.

1to	4	and	recording	the	result.
The	sample	space	is  S	=	{1,	2,	3,	4}.	
Some	subsets	of	this	sample	space	are  {3},	{2,	4},	{1,	2,	3}.	
These	subsets	can	be	explained	as	follows:{3}	denotes	''The	event	of	getting	3	as	the	result".{2,	4}	denotes	"The	event	of	getting	2	or	4	as	the	result".Probability 30

   An event is a subset of the sample space.
Simple events and composite events
Consider	rolling	an	unbiased	die	numbered	from	1	to	6.	In	this	random	experiment,
the	sample	space	is  S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6}.	
Let	us	write	some	events	relevant	to	the	sample	space.
{1},	{2},	{3},	{1" 3},	{2" 4},	{1" 3" 5},	{2" 3" 5},	{3" 4" 5" 6}
In	the	above	events,  {1},	{2}	and	{3}	consist	of	only	one	outcome	each.	Such	
events	are	called	 simple events.
An event consisting of only one outcome is called a simple event. 
Thus, {5},	{6}	are	simple	events.
Events	which	are	not	simple	are	called	 composite events.	The	events  {1" 3},	{2" 4},	
{1" 3" 5} are	composite	events.	These	composite	events	can	be	further	decomposed

Consider	the	following	random	experiments.		(i)	Two	unbiased	coins	are	tossed	simultaneously	and	the	sides	shown	are	recorded.			
It	is	clear	that	whatever	the	result	of	one	coin	toss	is,	it	will	not	affect	the	result	of	the	other.
(ii)	There	are	two	bags	containing	some	identical	balls.	One	ball	is	taken	randomly
						from	each	bag.	It	is	clear	that	the	ball	taken	from	one	bag	will	not	affect	what							ballis	taken	from	the	other	bag.(iii)	During	the	germination	of	a	few	planted	seeds,	germination	of	one	seed	does						not	have	an	impact	on	the	germination	of	the	other	seeds.
In	this	way,	if	one	event	does	not	affect	another,	the	two	events	are	called							
independent.The	independence	of	two	events	is	defined	as	follows.
We	have	learnt	that	two	mutually	exclusive	events	are	two	events	that	do	not	occur	
together.	But	what	is	meant	by	2	events	being	independent	is	that	the	occurrance	of	one	event	does	not	affect	the	occurrance	of	the	other	event.

The circle in the figure is divided into two parts by the two points A and B on the 
circle. These two parts are called arcs. When the two points A and B are such that 
the straight line joining the two points passes through the centre of the circle, that is, when it is a diameter, then the two arcs are equal in length. When this is not the case, the two arcs are unequal in length. Then the shorter arc is called the  minor arc
and the longer arc is called the major arc.

centre and on the circumference of a circle
Let us engage in the following activity to gain an understanding of the relationship between the angle subtended at the centre by an arc and the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the same arc.
  Activity
Draw a circle on a tissue paper and name its centre O. Mark two points on the circle such that a minor arc and a major arc are obtained. Name these two points as                                                                                                                                     A and B.

² Fold the sector of the circle AOB into two such that OA and OB coincide, to obtain 
an angle which is exactly half the size of AOBˆ.
² Place this folded sector on such that O overlaps with X and examine it.
You would have established the fact that the angle  AOBˆsubtended at the centre by 
the minor arc AB is twice the angle  subtended by this arc on the remaining 
part of the circle. In the same manner, mark arcs of different lengths on circles of 
varying radii and repeat this activity.

Angle of Elevation
   
     Line of vision
Angle of elevationObject
Eye level
Eye 
An angle of elevation is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision and 
the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object above the eye level.
Angle of Depression 
  Angle of depressionEye level
ObjectEyeLine of vision
An angle of depression is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision 
and the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object below the eye level.32
190 For free distributionNote:  Angles of elevation and angles of depression are always made with the 
horizontal level.
Exercise 32.1
1. Write down whether the angle marked with a letter in each picture is an angle of 
elevation or an angle of depression.
 32.2 Clinometer
When stating the position of an object in a vertical plane, we need to state the 
magnitude of the angle of elevation or depression. We may use a clinometer for the purpose of measuring these angles.

191 For free distributionA simple clinometer can be made in the classroom as follows:
• Cut out a semicircle with a radius of about 10 cm from a piece of cardboard.•  Mark both ends of the curved edge as 90
x and the middle of the curved edge as 0x. 
• Calibrate the curved edge in both directions from 0x, 10x by 10x as shown in the 
figure.
• Fix a straw along the straight edge of the semicircle.• Attach a small weight to one end of a piece of string longer than 10 cm and fix the 
other end to the center of the semicircle.
When the straw is horizontal, the string goes through 0
x. When the straw is inclined 
at an angle of 45x, for example, the string goes through 45x, in which case the straw 
shows a 45x vertical inclination.
Angles of elevation and depression can be measured in this manner using a clinometer.
Exercise 32.2 
1. From a suitable position find the angle of elevation of each of the points given 
below using the clinometer you made.
    (i) The top of the flagpole at your school.   (ii) The top of a building.  (iii) The top of a tree in your school.
32.3 Scale diagrams in a vertical plane
Now let us consider several instances when scale diagrams are used to represent information in a vertical plane.The figure below shows a tree and its shadow on the ground. Let us draw a scale diagram using the given information and hence find the height of the tree.
First we choose a suitable scale. Let 1 cm in the scale diagram represent an actual distance of 1 m. 
In other words, let 1 cm represent 100 cm. 
Therefore, the scale is 1:100.  
192 For free distributionAccordingly, we need to draw a line segment of 6 cm to represent 6 m. Let us  
represent this by a horizontal line segment AB,  (see the figure below). Now let us 
draw an angle of 50x at B and complete the triangle ABC such that BAC<
 = 90x as 
shown in the figure. 
A BC
50x
6 cmNow in the scale diagram, AC represents the height 
of the tree and you can measure and find that the length of AC is 7.2 cm. Hence, we can calculate the 
actual height of the tree as follows:                                                                                                                                      
Length of AC = 7.2 cm.  Since 1 cm in the scale diagram represents 100 cm,   height of the tree    = 7.2 cm « 100
                                             = 720 cm            = 
7.2 m
Example 1
From a sixty meter tall lighthouse a boat A is observed at sea with an angle of 
depression of 31x and another boat B with an angle of depression of 45x  (see the 
figure). The two boats and the lighthouse are in the same vertical plane. Draw a scale diagram depicting the above information and find the distance between the boats A and B. 
                  
6 cmA BC
50x
193 For free distributionFirst let us draw a sketch diagram using the given information. Next let us choose 
a suitable scale. Let us represent 10 m  by 1 cm.Since 1 m = 100 cm, In the chosen scale, 1 cm represents 1000 cm.        
 the scale is 1: 1000.
Note: When drawing scale diagrams involving objects at great distances, a man’s 
height being comparatively small can be ignored.
According to the scale, a 6 cm line must be drawn to represent the lighthouse’s height. Denote this line by CD.
Now, let us draw the scale diagram.
• First draw a vertical line segment of length 6 cm and label it CD.
• Draw two lines perpendicular to CD at C and D.
• Draw an angle of depression of 31
x at D. Extend this line to the point where it 
meets the line perpendicular to CD at C and label this point as A.
• Draw another angle of depression of 45x at D. Extend this line to the point where 
it meets the line perpendicular to CD at C and label this point as B.
• Now measure the length of AB. It  should be 4 cm.

In a horizontal playground, Dilini is standing at the location A, 5 m away from a 
netball goal post. 
She can see the top of the goal post T, with an angle of elevation of 18x from her 
eye level E. She can see the base of the goal post F, from the same position with an 
angle of depression of 15x. Draw a scale diagram and find Dilini’s height and the 
height of the goal post. When a diagram is not given, it is best to draw a sketch diagram prior to drawing 
the scale diagram.

Now, we have to choose a suitable scale for the scale diagram.
Let us take 2 cm to represents 1 m.Then, 2 cm represent 100 cm.
 1 cm represents 50 cm.
  the scale is 1: 50.
If 1 m is represented by 2 cm,  5 m is represented by 10 cm.
Note: Because the distance between the human and the pole is not large, we get a more accurate answer by taking the man’s height into consideration when drawing the scale diagram.
Now let us draw the scale diagram.       
• Because the distance between A and F is 5 m, draw a line segment of length 10 cm 
and label the two ends as A and F.
• Then, draw two lines at A and F,  each perpendicular to AF.
195 For free distribution• Because the point E is not yet determined, we cannot draw the angle of elevation 
or depression at E at once. Instead, we first find E as follows. Observe that                  
AFE
>
 = 15x because AFE
>
 and the angle of depression at E are alternate angles. 
Now draw an angle AFE
>
 of magnitude 15x at F such that E is on the line drawn 
perpendicular to AF at A.
• Now that we know point E, draw a line at E perpendicular AE.
• Draw the angle of elevation of 18x with the line drawn in the previous step. Label 
the point T which is the intersection point of the line of sight of this angle of 
elevation and the line drawn perpendicular to AF at F,  as shown in the figure.
• Dilini’s height is represented by AE and the height of the goal post is represented 
by TF.
Scale Drawing:

FT
10 cm18x
15x
According to the scale diagram,
           AE = 2.6 cm
 Dilini’s height  = 2.6 « 50 cm
                = 130.0 cm
      = 1.3 m'
                      
Also, from the scale diagram,                               TF = 6 cm
 the height of the goal post    = 6 « 50 cm
      = 300 cm       = 3 m'
