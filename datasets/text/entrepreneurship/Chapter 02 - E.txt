It is not necessary to explain about businesses.That is because we deal with 
businesses all the time. Think of goods and services we consume to fulfill our day 
to day needs and wants in the following contexts.
 Example :- 
  Wash yourself in the morning
           Have a cup of tea
  Prepare daily meals 
           Watch television
           Get ready to go to school or to work 
We need to consume a variety of goods and services for the above activities. Think 
about the complexity of processes from producing goods and services by different institutions and people to fulfil human needs. All the production and distribution of 
goods and services are done by businesses. Now we can identify what businesses 
are. 
Business refers to all the activities related to production and distribution of goods 
and services to fulfil human needs and wants. The people who  carry out these 
activities  are called businessmen.
2.2 Needs and Wants
The basic things which are essential in order to live are known as needs. The various ways by which the needs are fulfilled are called wants. Each want is created on a 
need. Accordingly, needs are fulfilled by satisfying wants.
