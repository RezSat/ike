Computer shopAre there any computers 
to suit the requirements 
of both of us?
Yes. Many types are available. 
We can either buy a computer or 
we can get a computer assembled 
to suit our requirements. Let’s go 
in and take a look around!
 
Identifying the user 1.1
 
 The one who uses a computer is generally referred to as a user. Different 
users working in different areas in Information and Communication Technologies 
have different designations. The following table shows a few such examples;
Table 1.1 : Types of users and their work
      User name Task

A computer to suit user requirements can be selected from those available in 
the market (Figure 1.2), or a computer can be assembled to suit user requirements. 
Computers can be classified according to their nature and use as follows; 
• Non - portable computers
Server computers, workstations, desktop computers and all-in-one 
computers, are all operated using the main electricity power supply. These 
computers are large in size and relatively heavy. Therefore, they are installed and used in places like houses, schools or offices. 
• Computers for mobile use 
Laptops, notebooks, tablet computers and a smart phones can be considered 
for mobile use. They operated with re-chargeable batteries. Therefore, they can be 
used when traveling in buses, trains, aeroplanes or from any convenient place.

as an input an output device.
Refer to workbook for Activity 1.2.
Computer specifications 1.4
What are computer specifications?
 Before purchasing an item, it is important to be aware of the value and the 
quality of the item. Specifications are generally about the common features of an 
item. 
 For example, length, width and paper thickness, etc. determine quality of an 
exercise book. Basic specifications for an exercise book are as shown. 
Basic specifications for an exercise book 
Length       : 210 mm
Width      : 148 mm
Number of pages     : 40
Thickness of paper    : 60 GSM
Type       : Single ruled  
Similar to the specification of a book, a computer also has its specification.
For free distribution
 7Specifications to suit different user requirements
Consider a situation where two students use two types of books for different 
purposes. For example, a square ruled exercise book for mathematics and a large 
size drawing book for art. Specifications for the two types mentioned above are as 
follows: 
Specifications for an exercise book 
Length     : 210 mm
Width     : 148 mm
Number of pages : 200
Thickness of paper  : 60 GSM
Type        : Square ruled Specifications for a drawing book
Length  : 300 mm
Width         : 210 mm
Number of pages     : 20
Thickness of paper     : 70 GSM
Type          : Blank
 Different specifications for different purposes may result in price differences 
as well. 
 The specifications change according to user requirements in the above 
example. Similarly depending on the use of a computer its specifications also 
differs. 
Specifications of computers and peripheral 
devices 1.5
The following shows some important factors of computer specifications;
Important - One can generally assure the quality of an item 
through its specifications.
 
1.5.1The processor 
Figure 1.4 : the human brainHumans are considered the most intelligent 
among all living beings. The brain (Figure 1.4) helps 
man to make decisions for actions taken. The brain also has the ability to swiftly respond to all sensations. 
8 For free distribution Much as the brain is most important for humans, the processor (Central 
Processing Unit) (Figure 1.5) is the most important part of a computer. The 
processor processes data swiftly. As such, the processor is considered the "Brain" of the computer. 
The side that connects to the mother 
board
Figure. 1.5 : Central Processing UnitView from above
Speed of the processor 
 A machine functions at a slower speed takes a longer time to complete a 
task while a machine functions at a higher speed takes a shorter or a lesser time to complete a task. Therefore, the amounts of work that could be carried out using these machines during a unit time differs.
 Blender working at slower speed
Blender working at higher speed
   Figure 1.6 : Preparation of fruit juice using blenders with different speeds  
For free distribution
 9 Figure 1.6 shows two blenders working simultaneously. The blender 
working at higher speed processes a larger quantity of fruit juice per unit time. A 
machine working at a higher speed provides better results.
 The performance of a computer depends on the speed of the processor. A 
processor running at high speed is able to process more data during a unit time. 
That is, the performance of the computer is increases. Then the software can be run faster. Therefore, when selecting a processor, it is advisable to select one with a greater speed. 
 The speed of the processor is measured by the number of instructions 
executed per second. 
Important - The speed of a computer is determined by the 
number of instructions execute per second. 
The speed is measured in Hertz (units such as MHz or GHz).
 
1000 MHz = 1 GHz
Processor manufacturers
Figure 1.7 : Different processorsSeveral processor manufacturing 
companies, Apple, Intel and AMD 
(Advanced Micro Devices) exists.
Types of processors  
  Generally, the number of processors  in a central processing unit is used to 
classify the Central Processing Unit. The following table shows examples of some Intel Central Processing Units with multiple processor units.

Dual Core Dual Core/Core 2 Duo
Quad Core Core i3, i5, i7, i9
Refer to workbook for Activity 1.3.
1.5.2Hard disk
 The hard disk provides permanent storage space for storing data and to 
installing all software. The hard disk is the main secondary storage device in a 
computer.
 For example, an exercise book with 160 pages provide more writing space 
than a book with 40 pages. Similarly, more data can be stored in a hard disk with a greater storage capacity. (see figure 1.8).

1.5.3The monitor display
The main output device of a computer is its monitor display. Most often, a 
user interacts with a computer via its monitor/ display.
Monitor size
For examples, a wall clock is larger than a wrist watch. Time is easily seen on 
a wall clock because of its size. Similarly, larger monitors have better visibility.      
A larger monitor size is useful in viewing a larger picture. The monitor size 
is measured in terms of its diagonal length in inches. (Figure 1.9).
19 inch
Figure. 1.9 : Monitor Size
Monitor technology
Monitors can be classified into the following types according to the 
technology used by them:
 ²CRT (Cathode R ay Tube) Monitor
 ²LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Monitor
 ²LED (Light Emitting Diode) Monitor
12 For free distributionCRT monitor  
LCD /LED monitor
Fig.1.10 : CRT  and LCD /LED monitor
 CRT monitors consume more electricity than the other two types. Further 
they are heavier and occupy more space due to its size. Hence, light weight LED 
and LCD monitors which consume less electricity are commonly used today. (See figure 1.10).
1.5.4Main memory
 Let us consider a shelf which is used to keep books and bags when entering 
a library (See figure 1.11). Students who enter the library keep their school bags in compartments. They takes their bags as they leave the library. 
 In a similar manners data and instructions are stored temporarily in the main 
memory (See figure 1.12) when the computer functions. A bigger rack for storage 
in a library can hold more school bags. Similarly, a higher capacity in the main memory stores more data and instructions. Therefore, a computer with a higher main memory capacity is better.

Important - The capacity of the main memory is measured in 
units of bits. (Mega Bite (MB) or Giga Bite (GB) etc).
1024 MB = 1 GB
Refer to workbook for activity 1.5.
1.5.5Video Graphic Adapter (VGA)
Figure 1.13 : VGA cardThe Monitor is the main output 
device of a computer. The output is fed to  the monitor via the Video Graphic Adapter (VGA). There are two types of Video Graphic Adapter (VGAs). On board VGA  is fixed to the mother board and Separate VGAs card can be fixed to mother board manually. The separate VGA card has a separate video memory and a processor. Separate VGA cards are useful for playing computer games.
Modern computers use DV1 or HDMI ports instead of VGA port (See Figure 
1.14).
Figure 1.14 : Types of video ports
When HDMI cables are connected to a computer, a television screen or 
multi media projector, both sound and video signals are transmitted. When a VGA is used for the same purpose, only images are transmitted and a separate cable is required for sound. 
14 For free distribution1.5.6Sound cards
 Many computer are widely used for entertainment today. A sound card is 
required for listening to music and recording audio. A microphone connected to the 
sound card can be used to record (input) sounds while a speaker connected to the sound card can be used to play (output) sounds.
 Most computers have the sound card built into the motherboard (See figure 
1.15). A user can also connect external sound card to the computer if necessary.

 Free and open source operating systems such as Linux, Ubuntu can be obtained free of charge. Licensed operating systems such as Windows 8, Windows 10 to purchase. A trial version of an operating systems such as trail version of Windows 10 can be used only for a limited period. Required application software depends on the requirement of the user. 
 In buying a desktop computer or a laptop computer it is important to check 
whether an operating system has been pre-installed. Most often only DOS or LINUX 
computer systems are pre-installed. A computer with licensed software installed is more expensive than a computer with a free and open source operating system.
16 For free distributionNon-technical features to be considered in 
purchasing a computer1.6
 Non-technical specifications such as manufacturer, type of book and price 
are considered in purchasing an exercise book. This applies to the purchase of a 
computer as well. Therefore, in purchasing a computer, non-technical specification must also be considered.
1.6.1Warranty 
 Warranty is an important factor to be considered when purchasing a 
computer. Warranty given by the vendor and the manufacturer assurers to cover the defects for a certain period. Customer can get this warranty in many different ways.
a. Manufacturer warranty
 The warranty which is given by the manufacturing 
company is known as the manufacturer warranty. If the device malfunctions during the warranty period, it is either repaired or replaced with a new one.
b. Extended warranty
 Extended warranty is a prolonged warranty given to customers in addition to the standard warranty. Customer needs bearing additional cost for extended warranty.
c. On-site warranty
 If a customer obtains an on-site warranty, technicians 
from the respective company visit the place of work to repair the product. They generally maintain, replace faulty parts and examine the operations of the machine. 
 There is a standard warranty when purchasing a computer. 
but, the warranty for the parts of the computer may differ from the 
standard.  
 For instance, a laptop computer with standard warranty for 3 years, may 
have only one year warranty for the battery.

 171.6.2Price
The price of a computer can vary according to the customer requirements.  
e.g.
1. The price of a computer is rather high with a high speed processor.
2. A computer with a large monitor is comparatively high in price.3. Price is low of a computer with a lesser memory capacity.4. A computer inclusive high capacity hard disk drive is high in price.
It is advisable to compare prices to suit one’s requirements from different 
places and select the computer with the lowest price.
 Refer to workbook for Activities 1.6 and 1.7
Important - It is not advisable to purchase a computer considering 
only its price.
1.6.3Services after-sale
Computer sales centers provide the following after-sales services to customers;
1. Technical advice
2. Technical assistance3. Telephone, e-mail and website information (i.e. contact information) of the 
    vendor
It is advisable for a user to consider the given information in purchasing a 
computer. Customer needs preparing specifications first. Then, a computer must be bought from a vendor with a reputed name and must be from a recognized manufacturer.   
Refer to workbook for Activity 1.8

Simple selection 3.1 
Head and tail of a coin
 You learnt in programming chapter of Grade 
8, ICT textbook that a simple selection is selecting 
one option out of two given options under a certain condition. For example, one such choice is the 
selection of “head” or “tail” with the toss of a coin.   
Scratch program 1Start
EndYes 
NoIs it head?

 31 Simple selection has one condition with two options. A selection is made 
out of the two conditions. If the condition is true, one option is selected and if not, 
the other option gets selected.
Refer to workbook for Activity 3.1.
Selection out of many options 3.2
Selection out of many options is about selecting one out of more than two 
options.

 32 In the above, a number will be displayed if one of the five conditions is 
satisfied or if non of the five conditions is satisfied.
Control structure with repetition 3.3
 Repetition is about an action getting 
repeated again and again.
  With repetition, both beginning and 
end is based on a condition.
Example 1   Displaying numbers 1 - 5
   Flowchart 3 : Display numbers 1 - 5Begin
End
Yes NoIs the 
number 5 or 
less than 5? 
Show numberNumber = 1
Add 1 to number
    In this flowchart the condition is, “Is the number equals 5 or less than 5”?
At the beginning, condition is 
checked and since the condition is true, the repetitive work commences.
Once the number is shown, 1 is 
added to it and the condition is checked again. 
When the number exceeds five, 
condition is not satisfied and the repetition ends.

 40Programming with arrays 3.7
What is an array?  
 In Grade 7, we learnt that to store values in programming, variables are 
needed. We need a number of variables that is equivalent to the number of values to be stored. 
 For example, consider storing marks gained by a student for five question 
papers on general knowledge.
 Five variables are required to store marks for the five question papers.  Name the variable as marks _ 1, marks _ 2, marks _ 3. marks _ 4 and marks 
_ 5. Marks earned by a student can be stored in these variables. Consider 78, 85, 69, 93, 87 to be the marks scored. 
marks_178
marks_285
marks_369
marks_493
marks_587
 Each variable needs giving a name when variables are used to store values. This is difficult when a large number of variables are used. Further, the program become complicated and large with large number of variables. In such instances, arrays are used to get over this problem.   
 An array is a data structure that can store any number of items using a single 
variable name. By using arrays, programs become less complex and the number of instructions can be reduced.
Building up arrays
Lists are used for arrays in Scratch. Lists can be built as follows in Scratch. 
e.g. - Using arrays to enter names of animals:
1. Select ‘Make a List’ from data
2. Give array a name3. Select ‘For this sprite only’4. Click 'OK'

 42Assigning items into arrays
 For example, after building an array named 'Country' to enter the names of 
five countries, the following code can be used to enter items to it.
 Scratch program 13
Displaying items in an array
 After entering data into an array named ‘Country’, the following program can be used to display its content to produce the output.
Scratch program 14
In the above program, v_con is a variable and ''Country'' is the name of the array.
 Let us consider an example where two Scratch programs to store the names 
and the marks of five students are processed. The first one uses multiple variables whereas the second one uses two arrays.

namesArray with 
marks
With the arrays in use, it is possible to use a repetition construct. This helps reduce 
the size of the program.  
Note - An array is termed a list in Scratch programming.
 
 Let us consider another example;
A school conducted a competition to select students for a general knowledge 
contest. The principal decided to select students who gained over 15 marks for the interview.
Five students are to face the interview. In the code shown below, using two arrays 
named 'Name' and 'Marks' the names of students having marks greater than 75 are shown.

 ²Repetition is about repeating a statement or a set of statements.
 ²A condition is necessary to begin and end a repetition.
 ²There are Scratch repetition control structures.
 ²There are three repetition control structures in Scratch:
i. Control structure for repetition a set number of  
 times (e.g. for 10 times)
ii. Control structure for repetition based on a  
 condition
iii.  Control structure for endless repetition
 ²Repetition within a repetition is called a nested 
repetition.
 ²There are a few nested repetition types:
i Repetition to satisfy a given condition
ii. Continuous repetition a fixed number of times
iii. Continuous repetition to satisfy a given 
condition
 ²An array is a data structure to store many items using a single name.
 ²Dividing a problem into smaller selections makes problem development

Components of microcontroller
A microcontroller consists of four basic components;
1. Central Processing Unit - CPU
    This processes data into information in order to provide the output.
2. Memory
    There are two types; 
i. Non-volatile memory
 The data in the non-volatile memory does not get erased even if 
there is no electricity. The program that the microcontroller should execute 
is stored in it.
       ii. V olatile memory
 Data in the volatile memory gets erased if there is no electricity. 
It functions as the Random Access Memory (RAM). This is used to store 
data as well as other results that are related when the microcontroller is at work. Data and instructions for the CPU are also held here.

 Small pins used to input data or output information belong to this 
category. Data is collected in both in analog and digital forms. Output is 
released in digital form.
Use of sensors and micro controllers
Solar lamp
 This contains solar cells, sensors and 
microcontroller. Solar cells microcontroller and light sensors cooperate to light the lamp. The solar lamp turns on automatically with the dark and turns off when there is light. Use of such solar lamps can minimize the waste of electricity. 
Washing machine
 Pressing buttons, the user gives instructions to 
the microcontroller for the wash. The microcontroller 
operates accordingly.
Microwave oven 
 The microcontroller in the microwave oven 
holds the heat for a specified period and stops.  
The user has to instruct regarding the required temperature and the duration.

Basic devices of a Network
The server manages the software, the 
hardware, the files and communication in the network. Any ordinary computer with the necessary software installed can be used as a server.
Server
The switch acts as the mediator between two or more computers. The switch recognizes the destination computer or the device when messages are sent from one computer to another in the network. 
e.g.-  when printing command is given from 
one computer that message is sent to 
the relevant device i.e. the printer via switch.
Switch

Refer to workbook for Activities 5.1 and 5.2
Use of a computer network to share resources 
and for communication5.2
Let us consider the basic objectives of computer networks.
Communication
Messaging
e-mailing
Sharing 
resources
Software and hardware 
Data and 
information
Basic objectives 
of using computer 
network
5.2.1Communication using a computer network
A computer network helps with easy 
communication among friends by messaging.A message can be directed to many friends in the network at one time.
The Command Line Interface (CLI) can be 
used for this purpose.
5.2.2Sharing resources using a computer network
e.g. 1 - Sharing hardware 
When a printer is connected to the network using cables or wireless, every one in the network can use it when arrangements are made as such.

For free distribution
 72Some other devices shared in a network. 
Scanner Fax machine
Advantages of using peripherals in common
 ²Ability to use common hardware with several computers
 ²Saving money
 ²Saving time
e.g. 2 - Sharing software 
 Each stand-alone computer may need individual software licenses. This 
is very expensive. However, buying multiuser software licenses for a computer 
network is relatively low. This saves a lot of money.
e.g. 3 - Sharing data and information
 Sharing data and information helps save time, money and storage capacity 
while increasing the efficiency and productivity.
File folder
 When a folder is shared in a network, all the files in 
the folder can be accessed by the users in the network.
This provides an opportunity to share images, photos, 
songs and videos, etc. among friends.

Note - Command Line Interface (CLI)
The command Line Interface is an 
interface that could be used to give typed 
commands to computer sequentially in the form of texts. Before the introduction of the Graphical User Interface, the operating system of the computer, had the command line interface. This interface can be used to send messages to the network users.
 In addition, the third party software such as LAN messages, Net send 
GUI, POP Messenger, also could be used for network user communications.
Computer networks
 ²A collection of two or more computers connected to share resources is 
a computer network. 
 ²Computer networking has many advantages. The basic objectives of 
networking are to share resources and to communications.

a society can develop with 
Information Communication 
Technology. Yet, Information 
Communication Technology has not  
yet reached some countries. Some 
countries lag behind.Most countries in the world 
are fast developing, aren’t 
they? Do you know the reasons 
for having two kinds of 
countries as the developed and 
developing
Digital divide
Some societies in the world have ready access to computers and the Internet  
while some others do not. This gap between those who have and those who have 
not is known as the digital divide .
