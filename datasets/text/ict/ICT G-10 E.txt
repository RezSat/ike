²   how to identify data and information
²   what a system is²   the systems we come across in our day to day activities²   characteristics of quality information²   Information and Communication Technology²   applications of Information and Communication Technology²   evolution of the computer
 1.1   Data and Information
  The numbers, words, images and symbols which do not bear a meaning, 
when standing alone are called data.While we can arrive at meaningful information by arranging and processing data, we can use them to make decisions also.
Example 1
	 It	will	be	difficult	to	get	an	idea	about	the	subjects	and	marks	if	names	and	marks are written separatly on term test results.
Ravi 78, 90, 79, 67, 76, 98   Rizwan 87, 70, 80, 75, 80, 80   Krishan 76, 78, 67, 80, 79, 76
But these names and marks can be tabulated as follows:
Name Language Mathematics Science History Health English
Ravi 78 90 79 67 76 78
Saman 76 78 67 80 79 76
Rizwan 87 70 80 75 80 80
  This table shows some information about the marks of students. However, 
in	order	to	arrive	at	some	meaningful	conclusion,	this	may	not	be	sufficient:1Information and Communication 
Technology
For free distribution2	 Marks	that	were	tabulated	can	be	subjected	to	calculation.
Name Language Maths Science History Health English Total Average Rank
Ravi 78 90 79 67 76 78 468 78 2
Saman 76 78 67 80 79 76 456 76 3
Rizwan 87 70 80 75 80 80 472 78.66 1
	 In	this	table,	name	and	subjects	such	as	language,	maths	are	data	and	total,	
average and rank are information. 
You can see that the teacher is able to get the required information using 
this table (i.e. the total score of each student, their average scores, individual skill of each student, the rank etc). The information gathered in this manner is useful for the teacher to take important decisions.
Example 2
To identify the difference between data and information, let us consider the following Figures;
When we take each image separately, it does not convey a meaning. But when properly arranged as on the right hand side, one can understand that these are the members of one family.

  Number 0-4 denotes that the person is a male
  Number 5-9 denotes that the person is a female  Example  3 
Analyzing NIC numberTake	a	look	at	the	numbers	in	a	National	Identity	Card.	At	once	it	looks	as	if	it	is	just	
a number. But when you analyze it, you can obtain some meaningful information.When	the	NIC	number	is	given	one	could	find	the	person's	age	and	gender.
 1.2     Information System
Once, man used to process data using a pen, pencil or other devices. But 
today the computer has become man’s data processor.  A system is a combination of 
components	that	work	together	to	fulfil	a	task.  
Submitting data for processing is called “Input” and the result we get after 
processing is called “Output.” We can call the collection of all these components above a “Information System.” 
Storing data is an important task in information system. In some occasions, 
both input and stored data are used to obtain information.
Hence the purpose of a system is to receive data, process and store them and 
provide the results when required.	 According	to	the	figure	1.3  a computer processes the data that we input, 
according to the commands and provide us with the required information in the desired form. Therefore, we call the computer an ‘ Information System’. Activity

We use many such systems in our day today activities. Let us consider some

For free distribution6A computer or computerized equipment is used to process the data and we 
make decisions based on the information we get as output.
We u nderstand that we can get information by processing data and this 
information can be used to arrive at decisions. However, not all information is 
suitable for making decisions. Information obtained should be of good quality. There are many characteristics of quality information. A few of them are given below:
Quality of information Example
a) Relevancy                 It is not needed to submit all the academic information 
from Grade 1 onwards, when the requirement is to submit only	the	highest	educational	qualification.
b) Completeness            Taking information from only a small group of people in order to arrive at the PCI (Per Capita Income) of a country is	not	sufficient.	Incomplete	information	could	lead	to	drawing wrong conclusions.
c) Accuracy                   If a doctor gets wrong information about the patient’s health, it could be harmful to the patient. 
d) Timeliness                The information must always be updated. Today’s weather report	 may	 not	 be	 suitable	 to	 decide	 on	 tomorrow's	weather.
e) Cost Effectiveness If	an	organization	spends	money	more	than	the	profits	to	
collect	some	information	in	order	to	increase	profits,	it	would be a business loss to the organization.

 1.3    Information and Communication Technology
We learnt that we can get information by processing data and that 
information can be used to make decisions and arrive at conclusions. When we 
exchange	the	information	among	different	people	or	among	different	systems,	it	is	called communication of information.  
	 Man	has	been	processing	and	exchanging	information	since	ancient	times.	But	he	had	to	face	many	difficulties	and	obstacles	in	data	communication.	But	today it has become an easy task with the advancement of  technology.
Today, technology is used in various ways to convert data into information 
and	 then	 to	 exchange	 them.	 This	 is	 called	 Information	 and	 Communication	Technology (ICT).
 1.4   Applications of Information and Communication                 Technology
Today, you could hardly come across any person or a place that does not 
use information and communication technology in day to day activities. Some examples	are	illustrated	below:

When a government communicates with its citizens, companies, Government 
and Non-Government Organizations and with other Governments (of different 
countries) using ICT, it is called e-Government.	 There	are	numerous	web	sites	such	as	official	web	portal	of	the	government	of Sri Lanka, Government Information Center, ICTA (Information Communication Technology	 Agency)	 etc	 for	 e-Government	 activities.	 The	 difficulties	 in	communicating with the Government and obtaining Government information have been overcome by these.

Days are gone when we were stuck among piles of books in order to collect 
the	required	information.	Today	you	have	the	luxury	to	see	and	gain	knowledge	
about the entire world at your own convenience, due to all the advancements of ICT.
There are many ways as to how ICT helps you in your education. Let us 
look at some of them:

²   Creation of images and video
²  Desktop publishing of magazines, letters and      documents²   Educational games (Edutainment)²   Learning using the CD-ROM media² Gathering educational information on the  
     internet
b) Education - any where anytime     If you have a computer with internet connection, you can study while at 
home or any other convenient place. For this, you can use the following educational 
websites to do self study and improve your knowledge within your pace.
²  www.schoolnet.lk²   www.nenasala.lk²   www.e-thaksalawa.moe.gov.lk²  www.vidumanpetha.com
You can contact with a teacher/trainer via 
internet. This is called WBT (Web based Training). While you can do further studies using WBT, it helps	in	minimizing	the	difficulties	of	travelling	and	related	expenses	also.	At	the	same	time,	it	helps save time and money.

      electronic presentations.
 ²To organize lessons using the computer.
 ²To obtain information relevant to the 
	 subjects.	
d) Learning Management System (LMS)
In many countries it has become a common practice to use a Learning 
Management System to manage school system and higher education system. We 
need an internet connection to link with the LMS. A person has to register himself/herself	on	the	official	website	to	access	LMS	of	a	school	or	any	other	educational	institution. According to the picture 1.14, teachers and students can get many services from LMS.

e) Higher education for everyone
With the development of ICT, today a person 
from any country can connect with a university or any other learning center of his choice and pursue higher education at a considerably low cost. This is called Online Distance Learning.
Features of Distance Learning:
• Within	a	flexible	time	frame,	provide	the	facility	to	learn
• Digital	library	facility	on	joining	a	course.	
• Online assignments and quizes. 
• Contact with a teacher online. • Easy to obtain teacher consultations.Figure 1.15 -

Devices used to analyse store and print medical records.
There are plenty of areas where ICT is used in the health sector for our 
well- being. Let us consider some of them.
1' Use of ICT in diagnosis
       Today, there are numerous high tech machines which help us in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Diseases can be diagnosed at the early stages and the patients	can	be	given	treatment	accordingly.	Some	examples	of	these	machines	are:
Example 1 - CAT - Computerized Axial Tomography Machine  
Using this machine three dimensional (3D) images of different parts of the 
body can be made. These images are helpful in the diagnosis of diseases.

This machine can 
create digitalized images 
of internal organs of the body by using strong magnetic	fields	and		radio	waves. These images are very helpful in the detection and deciding on treatment of diseases.
Example 3 - ECG  - Electrocardiogram Machine
          This machine is 
used to monitor the heart beat. When the heart pumps blood to different parts of the body some electrical impulses are produced. This machine records the electrical impulses. 
Example 4 - Cardiac Screening Machine
 This machine 
displays the physiology 
of the heart and it displays the movements inside the heart. Through this machine it is possible to diagnose problems of the heart such as thinning of vains and then recommend treatment.

Example 1 - Emergency Telemedicine                                                                  
Emergency telemedicine is the process 
of providing emergency care by a trained person 
in consultation with a specialist in a hospital via telecommunication network and treating him when a	patient	(who	lives	in	a	remote	village	or	flying	in	a	plane or cruising in a ship) can not reach a hospital.

Example 3 - Telemedicine Consultation 
Seeking medical consultation of a 
specialist at the Emergency Treatment Unit 
(ETU) when he/she is not physically available in hospital.                                                                      
Example 4  -  Telesurgery (Remote Surgery)
Remote surgery is the ability of a doctor 
to perform surgery on a patient in consultation 
with a specialist (who is not physically present at the same location but in a far away town or abroad) by the use of Telecommunication Technologies.      
                                                                        
Example 5 - Medical Teletraining 
Specialists’ consultation and training 
can be used to obtain the services of a medical 
professional at a remote place by the use of telecommunication technologies. In training hospital staff, specialist consultation and training from a resource person in a foreign country or town can be attended, using telecommunication technologies in a nearby training centre.

Not only does ICT help us as enabler to perform our day today activities, it 
has become a close companion also. However, if you associate this companion in 
an undue manner it may bringforth undesirable effects to you as well to the entire society. The following are some of them.
• Addiction – A student or any other person who immerses himself/herself in 
the	excessive	use	of	computer	or	who	plays	games	on	internet	without	a	limit,	may lose the track of education and/or end up with ailments such as sore eyes, back pain,  headache etc.
• Building unsuitable friendships through social media.• When the computer is infected by virus due to improper use of internet, it may 
not function properly or go out of order.
• Mental disorders may affect a person causing harm to himself/herself and to 
society by visiting improper websites.
• Publishing of distorted photographs and videos of individuals affecting their 
personal lives.

• isolation
• violating copyrights
There is an opinion that ICT has negative impacts on human society due 
to issues mentioned above. But we have understood that the systems made by ICT make	most	of	man's	usual	work	easy.	Therefore,	it	is	our	responsibility	to	use	ICTin a responsible manner.
 1.6   Evolution of the Computer
By now you would have understood that computers assist us in converting 
data into information. Even though at present, there are automated computer systems, the computer too has undergone a similar evolution process as human beings and has reached the advanced stage today.
The computer was born in the attempt to make an adding machine. In order 
to add numbers, a device called Abacus was invented around 5000 years ago.
    
In due course many new inventions were made. The followings are  few of them:
• In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented a machine called 
the Adding Machine. This was the world’s	first	ever mathematical machine. 
• In 1674, Gottfried Wilhelm V on Leibnitz improved the machine invented by Pascal. With these improvements the machine was able to perform multiplication and division too.  
• A French Scientist named Joseph Jacquard invented a mechanical loom using Punch Card System.
• Charles Babbage started to make his Analytical Engine using the Punch Card System concept. This machine was based on the concepts input, process, output and store. Since this concept helped in the development of the computer, Charles Babbage is called the father of computing.
• Madam	Ada	Augusta	Lovelace	is	considered	as	the	first	programmer	since	she	tried to write programmes for the Analytical Engine.
• In the year 1944, a man named Howard Aiken invented the machine called Automatic Sequence Control Calculator at the Harvard University with the assistance of his companions and IBM Company. This was named MARK 1.
All the versions of early computers were mechanical in nature. From the 
time when the computers became automated they were categorized into various ‘Generations’ as below:

2.1    What is a computer? 
 First chapter described how computer systems can make day-to-day work 
efficient. 
 A computer can be described as an electronic device, which accepts or 
collects data, processes them according to the given instructions and produces the 
desired output.
 Computer has become an essential device in our lives. Some of these 
features of a computer can be described as follows; 
Speed A computer takes only a few seconds to perform calculations. 
It executes more than one million instructions per second. 
Accuracy A computer provides correct output when correct instructions and data are given.
Efficiency A computer  never gets tired. It can work round the clock with the same level of accuracy.
Versatility A computer can be used to perform many tasks simultaneously. This is one of the special features of a computer. 
Storing and RetrievingA computer is used to store large number of data and information in a relatively small unit and we can retrieve them easily and quickly when needed.

2.2.1 Classification according to physical size
(i)   Super Computers
 These computers have higher 
computing power. Computing power 
means the tasks that can be completed within a specific time period. They are large in size, expensive and rare.(Figure 2.2) These are used for scientific 
and engineering functions and to solve complex mathematical problems. For example, these computers are used in institutes like NAZA, large scale businesses and for military purposes.     
(ii)    Mainframe Computers
 These have relatively less physical size, computing power and are less 
expensive than the super computers. In mainframe computers, a number of users get connected to one computer using a number of terminals sharing, saving and retrieving data. (Figure 2.3 and 2.4) These are used in large scale businesses, in e-business and with super computer transactions done using internet. This type of computers are used even today in some large commercial institutions.

 The main functions of a computer system is to input data, process and store 
data, and to produce information when needed. Several components are used for such functions. The following is the function of a computer system;
 
 
 Data and instructions fed to the computer via an input device first go to the 
Primary Memory. Then those are sent to the CPU for processing.  The processed 
data stored in the Primary Memory as information is sent to the output device. The data and information which are to be stored are sent to the Secondary Storage Device. The stored information can be sent to an output device through Primary Memory. Control Unit sends the control signals to all the devices attached to the computer system. Computer memory contains data and instructions. When a computer programme works, the relevant data and instructions are sent to CPU.
 The flow of the data and instruction is indicated by a dotted line and the 
control signals are indicated by a solid line in the diagram above.

There are two main types of printers. These are,
1'  Impact Printers
 Impact printers are a primary level device in the printing technology. Impact 
printer refers to a class of printers that have a head or needle which strike against 
an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper. Its function it is noisy. However, since the ink ribbon used is not expensive, this is used in banks and shops for printing receipts etc. The following are some of the impact printers.
Example 1 - Dot Matrix Printer
 Letters are printed on the 
paper as small dots here when the printer’s head strikes on the inked ribbon with needle like tips.

2.4.3  Central Processing Unit - CPU
 
 This is the main component of a computer system. It is also called the brain 
of the computer as well as it functions according to the given commands. CPU 
manages the operating system and application software. CPU consists of three main components. The functions of those are as follows;
1. Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU) Perform all mathematical and logical functions.
2. Control Unit (CU) Controls all devices of a computer system.
3. Memory Registers Temporarily stores data needed for the function of ALU and the information produced by ALU.
   Main Components of Central Processing Unit

 Several computer memory or storage devices are used to store data and 
information and the functions of each are different. Computer memory can be 
classified as follows. 
  
  Random Access Memory (RAM) is often referred as Main Memory.(») Primary Memory
 The memory that can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit is 
called primary memory/storage. There are three types of Primary Memory.
∗   Random Access Memory (RAM)
 This memory temporarily stores data. 
(Figure 2.40) The data stored in RAM will be deleted when the computer is switched off. 
Therefore this is also called volatile memory.  
Data coming from input devices as well as data sent to output devices are held in RAM. When comparing to ROM, which is discussed after this, RAM has both read-write facility. 
∗ Read Only Memory (ROM)
 The data in Read Only Memory is not erased 
when the computer is switched off. Therefore it is a 
Non-volatile Memory. The commands required for booting up a computer are stored in ROM. These commands are called BIOS (Basic 
Input Output System). Computer Manufacturing companies store these commands in a ROM with a smaller capasity and is connected to the mother boars (Figure 2.41).Computer Memory

 Though this is smaller in capasity than other memory, it is faster. This is also 
called CPU Memory. This acts as the mediator between CPU (Central Processing Unit) and Primary Memory. The data frequently used by are stored here. (Figure 2.42) The Central Processing Unit checks cache memory first to see whether the required data is available for processing. However, if the required data is not available then the data is fetched to cache memory from RAM for processing. 
(»»)  Secondary Memory
 Secondary Memory or the Secondary Storage is the device which stores 
data and information permanently. This is also called External Storage. There are internal storage devices as well as external portable secondary storage devices. Secondary memory is called non-volatile memory since it does not erase when electricity is not available. (Figure 2.43) These can be classified as follows.     Figure 2.42 - Cache Memory

 Data is stored here by using magnetic field. 
Example 1 - Hard disk Drive
 The Hard Disk Drive (HDD), which is commonly used to store data and 
information, is located inside the computer. However, there are external hard disks as well. Today there are hard disks with large capacity due to the development of the technology. The user can read and write the data stored in HDD. Therefore, this medium is called Read / Write Memory. The capacity of a hard disk ranges from 250 GB to 4 TB. The maximum capasity will increase with technological development.
Hard Disk is made of several components. 
1. Platter – This is a metallic, aluminum 
or ceramic disk and data can stored 
on both sides using magnetic media. There can be several platters in a hard disk.
2. Spindle – Holds the platter and rotates it.
3. Head – Reads the magnetic data in the platter and writes on the platter. There are two heads for a platter; one on top and one on bottom.
4. Actuator arm – Moves the head. Enables reading and writing  data anywhere in the platter.
5. Power connector – Connects the Hard Disk to power which is needed for 
 its function.
6. IDE connector – Transmits data to the 
platter
7. Actuator – An electronic device which moves the arm connected to it. This is operated by a motor.                 Figure 2.44 - Hard Disk

There are several modes of data transmission between sender and receiver.
 1)  Simplex Mode
 Data is transmitted from the sender to the receiver only. Getting print outs, 
watching television, and listening to radio can be given as examples
Figure 2.59 - Simple mode communication
             
 2)  Half- duplex Mode
 Here, data is transmitted to one direction at a time. This means after data is 
transmitted from sender / source to the receiver, the receiver can transmit data back 
to the sender / source. Browsing internet to get information and walkie-talkie used by security forces can be given as examples.

 If the medium used for data transmission is a physical medium, it is called 
guided or wired.
Example 1 - Twisted Pair
 Pairs of twisted copper wire are used for data 
transmission. There are two types.
1.    Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
 The twisted copper wire pairs used for 
telephone connections. These are very flexible and 
low-priced. However, it is difficult to transmit data for a long distance through UTP wires.  It is suitable for maximum of 100 meters.
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) 
 STP is a better quality and secure data 
transmission medium. However it is expensive. 
(Figure 2.64)
Example 2 -  Coaxial Cable
 This consists of an electronic cable pair. The 
outer cable which is like a braided copper net produces 
electromagnetic field around the central cable. These two cables are separated by a plastic shield. These cables are expensive and used for TV antenna and CCTV . 
Example 3 - Fiber Optics cable
 Fiber Optics cable consists of a pair of an 
cables. There is a plastic jacket to separate the two 
cables. Core is a glass tube and there is glass cladding around it. (Figure 2.66). The data transmission is carried out  by while reflecting light. These are used in modern telephone networks. The cable is relatively more expensive. This is the fastest data transmission media at present.

connected with each other. (Figure 2.90) Since this is a complex connection pattern, it is costly and difficult to control. However, a breakdown of one computer does not affect the connections in the network. Mesh networking can be found on internet.
2.5.8  Benefits of Networkings  
Data and information can be shared between computers.The main advantage of networking is sharing data and information between computers. Data and information in a server, can be accessed by clients connected to the server.

For free distribution662.5.9  Disadvantages of Networking
Possible security issues
One major disadvantage of networking 
is the difficulty in securing data. Server can be accessed through any computer connected to the network. Hence it is difficult to secure it from the hackers (people who try to gain access to data without permission). 
Breakdown of network
In some topologies, breakdown of a computer or a cable can affect the function of the other computers of the network.
Virus
If one of the computes in the network gets a virus attack, this can spread to other computers as well.
Computer break downs
Due to defects or breakdown of the server, the other the clients can be affected. 
Training requirements
The need for a person who is specialized in network administration.

When typing letters or words using the computer, these words or letters 
are represented by the computer as numbers it can understand. While this group of 
numbers that the computer can understand is called a 'Number System' the limited number of numerals in the number system called digits. The value of these numbers (numerals) depends on the position they occupy within the number.
While the concept of number system was present in the 'Abacus ' considered 
as the first calculating machine of the world, it has progressed up to the computer of today.
The number system used for the representation of data in the computer is as 
follows;

4' Hexa - decimal 16 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
3.1.2  Use of Binary Numbers in Computer Data Representation
Computer represents data in two signal states. There are two V oltage levels 
for these two symbols. One is named as the high voltage level and the other is 
named as low voltage level. ''0'' and ''1'' digits respectively represent these low and high voltage levels in a circuit. Thus, ''1'' and ''0'' status are equal to the “On” and “Off” states of an electronic circuit.  Any data in the world can be represented on the computer using these two digits.
According to the Figure 3.3 given below, when data 
stored in Secondary Storage is sent to the Main Memory and when it is sent to the Central Processing Unit from there, that data are  converted to a binary code.

numbers are used for computer colours. Any colour can be made with the combination of different degrees of red, green and blue.
These can be 
represented as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and the value of any colour ranges from 0 to 255. 
For instance, if you need to use dark purple for the background of a document, 
that colour can be represented in the computer as “135, 31, 120”  (Figure 3.4). With these numbers, the colour combination for the above colour is represented in decimal numbers.  Binary numbers for 135, 31 and 120 are 100000111

3.2.4  Hexa-Decimal Number System
 The computer uses binary numbers and it is difficult for human beings to 
read them. Hence, the hexadecimal number system is used as it is easier for humans to use. Normally, calculations are performed using the ten fingers of the hands. Just imagine you have sixteen fingers on your hands. Then you can use sixteen numbers to count. In the hexadecimal number system, ten digits are used from 0 to 9 and for the other 6 digits, A, B, C, D, E and F symbols are used. Here, A, B, C, D, E and F are used to represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. (Table 3.5)

When F the largest number of hexadecimal number system, is expressed 
in binary form, it can be indicated with 4 Bits. Thus, instead of using a binary 
number with 4 Bits, a single number in hexadecimal number system can be used. For example, Hexadecimal numbers are used to represent memory addresses of the computer.
You can see code “# 871F78” related to the dark purple colour shown in 
Figure 3.4. Here the value of the colour is started with “#” symbol. The colour value is indicated in the computer in hexa decimal numbers. Thus, the code for dark purple in the above example is “# 871F78”.  R,G,B values of this can be indicated from 0 to 255 in decimal numbers. If “#’ or “&H” (ampersand) symbol is used in front of the value of any value, it is a hexa decimal number. Given below in Table 3.7 are the hexa decimal values and RGB values of dark purple colour.

3.6   Data Storage Capacity
 A certain space is needed to store data in the computer. Data storage 
capacity is measured by units such as bits, bytes, kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes and Petabytes. Let us understand how to arrange these different data storage capacities in order from the small unit to the big unit and to define the relationships between these as well.
3.6.1  Units to Measure Data Storage
Bit
 This is the smallest unit used in the computer to store data. This word is 
coined from the words                  A bit is the two binary digits; 0 and 1.
Byte
  1 byte is 8 bits.
Nibble
 A nibble is half of a byte or 4 bits. This unit is not commonly used like bits  
 and bytes. 
kilobyte
 This consists of 1024 bytes. (1024 = 210) Kilobyte is written as KB or kbyte.
Binary Dig it
              For free distribution 93Megabyte
This consists of 1024 kilobytes (1024 = 210) or 1048576 bytes. Megabyte 
is written as MB or mbyte.
Gigabyte
One Gigabyte is made of 1024 Megabytes. (1024 MB) Gigabyte is written 
as GB or gbyte. It is wrong to write ‘Gb’ as it indicates gigabit.
Terabyte
One Terabyte is made of 1024 Gigabytes (1024 GB). This is written as TB.
Petabyte
One Petabyte is made of 1024 Terabytes (1024 TB).
In production of hard discs there are instances 1024 is considered as 1000.
Following are the relationships between units which measure 
data storage capacity. 8 bits    =  1 byte
 4 bits    =  1 nibble
   1024  bytes  =  1 kilobyte (KB)
     1024  kilobytes =  1 Megabyte (MB)
     1024  Megabytes =  1 Gigabyte (GB)
     1024  Gigabytes =  1 Terabyte (TB)  
     1024  Terabytes =  1 Petabyte (PB) Observation
Consider the examples given below to get an idea about the units above.

Figure 3.15 – Data you enter to the computer and computer data representation
According to the above figure (Figure 3.15), when you enter a data to the 
computer, it converts the data to different patterns made of 0 and 1. Thus, binary 
codes are used when storing numeric, alphabetic, special character, images and sounds in internal storage devices of computers.
In the beginning of the lesson, when you type ‘A’ on the keyboard, the 
code you get for ‘A’ is the bits pattern 1000001 (the binary code of letter ‘A’). The number of bits used is 7. Thus, a combination made of a bit pattern is used to represent each data and the bits used for each code is different. Following are different coding systems used.
    1. BCD  Binary Coded Decimal
2. ASCII  American Standards Code for Information Interchange
3. EBCDIC  Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
4. Unicode
3.7.1  BCD - Binary Coded Decimal
This coding system was used in the early stages of computing. In this system 
one digit is represented by 4 bits. This is used only to represent decimal numbers. Sixteen symbols (2
4 = 16) can be represented in this system. The table 3.15 shows 
the BCD codes for the 10 digits from 0 to 9.

3.7.3  EBCDIC – Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange 
 Code
We can write only 128 characters using ASCII system, but the EBCDIC 
code system allows the use of  256 characters. Here, one symbol can be written with 
a binary number which consists of 8 bits. Hence, 256 characters can be represented using this system. This system was used in IBM main frame computers. The table below shows that there are different EBCDIC codes for the 26 different capital letters and 26 different EBCDIC codes for the 26 simple letters in this system.

Though 128 characters can be used in the ASCII system and 256 
characters can be used in the EBCDIC system for data representation. For 
example, these systems cannot be used for Sinhala, Japanese, Chinese and Tamil languages as there are more than 256 characters. Hence Unicode system was designed according to a standard to represent 65536 different symbols of 16 bits (2
16 = 65536). 
As per the figure given below (Figure 3.16), shows the Unicode system 
can be used to represent Sinhala and Tamil letters, and special symbols and picture symbols.

4.1   Introduction  
Communication happens in various ways among living beings in day to 
day life. Drumming was used in the past, as a method of communication. Further, 
a railway guard in a station blows a horn waving a green flag to signal that a train is going to leave. A green light should be there for the train to start and if it is a red light, the signal is to stop.
Usually, two keys are used to open a safe and both keys are needed to open 
it. Before you start a journey in a car, all its doors should be closed properly. If at least one door is not closed properly, a light will be on or there will be a sound for the driver to signal it. When all the doors are closed, this signal will be stopped. Further, you should wear seat belts if you are seated in the front seats of a car. Otherwise there will be a signal to indicate this. Thus, as we use signals in our day to day life to make decisions, the computer also uses signals.

4.2   Logic Gates
Circuits which enable building of certain logical conditions using binary 
values and which enable making certain decisions, are called Logic Circuits. The 
Computer is made of a large number of complex digital circuits. These electronic circuits are designed as required connecting a large number of basic logical circuits called logic gates. 
Central Processing Unit is made up of a collection of a large number of 
logic gates.
The following Figure 4.1 shows a circuit made up of basic. logic gates; 
AND, OR, and NOT.
The function carried out by a logic gate is giving an output considering an 
input or several inputs. 
There are numerous of technical methods to produce logic gates and its 
internal circuit consists of devices such as transistors, diodes and resistors. 
According to the way that the circuits are used, logic gates can be classified, 
into two types.

For free distribution 1104.3   Basic Logic Gates
There are three types of basic logic gates. Those are,
1. AND  gate   
2. OR  gate
3. NOT gate
4.3.1  AND Gate
Let us consider the example given below to understand AND logic.
• If the door of your computer lab is locked with a key and padlock, both door key and padlock key are needed to open that door. If both keys are there, you can open the door. If either door key or padlock key is used, you cannot open the door. Further, if keys are not there, you cannot open the door. 
• Let us consider the simple series electronic circuit given below to understand AND operation.

Logic GateHere, the two switches A and B, bulb Q and two batteries are connected in series. 
Let us consider the two switches as input and the bulb as output.
When both switches A and B are closed only, the bulb will be switched on. The 
bulb will not be switched on when either switch A or B is closed. When both switches are 
open, the bulb will not be switched on. 
If Logic 1 indicates both switches are closed and the bulb is switched on (Figure 
4.2) and if Logic 0 indicates when one switch is open and the bulb is switched off (Figure 4.3), the relationships between AND logic gate inputs and outputs are given below. (Table 4.1)
  
 
 Here, Q=1 when both A and B input are 
in “1” state only. When either inputs are in “0” state 
Q = 0. This table is called the truth table for AND logic gate.
Four states (2
2  = 4) are shown in the table as this gate consists of two inputs.
Logic of AND gate is “A” AND“B”.  According to Boolean expressions, it 
is represented as A.BTable 4.1 – Nature of the bulb in the circuit for AND

 Let us consider the simple electronic circuit given below. (Figure 4.8 and 4.9)
  Here A and B two switches and Q bulb are connected to two batteries in  
parallel. Let us consider the two switches A and B as input and the bulb as output.
  
 The bulb of this circuit will be 'on' when either A or B switch or both A and 
B switches are closed. This can be tabulated as follows. (Table 4.4)

(Figure 4.7). The state  when both switches are open or the bulb is switched off 
(Figure 4.8) is indicated as logic “0”. This table is called the Truth Table for OR logic gate. (Table 4.5)
 When both input of the above OR gate is 0, output will always be 0. Further, 
when all inputs are 0 of an OR logic gate with more than 2 inputs, output will 
always be 0. In the above table (Table 4.5), when A=1 or B=1 or both A and B are in state 
"1", Q=1. This table is called the Truth Table related to the OR logic gate.  In Boolean algebra, this operation is symbolically represented as “A + B”. 
Note that this is not the addition operation you use in Mathematics to add numbers. Further, it is not the plus mark to indicate a plus number. Hence, it represents “A OR B”. Given below in Figure 4.9 is the Boolean algebra expression related to the

Let us learn about the complement symbol to understand the NOT gate. The 
task of the NOT gate is to provide the complement as the output. Thus, complement 
of “0” is “1” and the complement of “1” is “0”.  
The NOT gate is the electronic circuit that provides the complement as the 
output of the input. Let us consider the circuit given below. (Figure 4.12)
When the A switch is closed, the bulb is not switched on as no electricity 
runs through. However, when the A switch is open, the bulb will be switched on. When the input is A here, the complement of A is the output. In Figure 4.13 is the Boolean algebra expression related to the NOT operation and its circuit symbols.R

 The function of devices such as  the computer, calculator, washing machine, 
microwave oven, mobile phone, modern televisions, digital clock, air condition etc is based on the function of logic gates. There are circuits which are designed  with various logic gates to get the required output. Such combinational logic circuit can be designed using basic logic gates.
4.4.1  NOR Gate
 The logic gate which indicates NOT OR (i.e. complement operation of the 
OR operation) is called the NOR gate. The logic of the NOR gate is the combination of OR and NOT to get the output from NOT after leading the output to NOT from OR gate. This can be shown as follows. (Figure 4.14)
The truth table for this can be built based on basic truth tables. (Table 4.7)A Q

When the both inputs of the NOR logic gate is 0, the output is always 
"1". Further, in an NOR logic gate with more than 2 inputs, when all those inputs are 0, output is always 1.
Thus, the NOR gate is equivalent to the OR and NOT gates connected 
in series. Following is the Boolean expression for the  NOR gate and the circuit symbols.

complement operation of AND or NOT AND operation is called the NAND gate. This is equivalent 
to connecting output of AND gate to a NOT gate in series. This can be shown as follows. (Figure 4.18)The logic circuit with output Q and inputs A, B and C is given below. (Figure 4.16)

a theft at home. This is designed using OR gates. This circuit protects two windows, 
the front and back door of the house. When any window or door is opened, an alarm system will be on. The logic gates which is connected to windows and doors are connected to sensors. Input is "1" when windows or doors are open; input is 0 when windows or door are closed. As shown in Figure 4.27, when all the inputs are 0, there will be no alarm.

Circuits designed to control street lights.
Following Figure 4.29 is a circuit designed using logic gates to control street 
lights. This is designed using a dark / light sensor, timer and a manual switch. 
There are several occasions when the lights are on. These are,
• When only the manuals switch is closed• When the input of the timer is 1 and when the environment is dark• When only the manuals Switch is closedStatus 
open = 0closed = 1warning state = 1no warning state = 0
              For free distribution 127When the manual switch is closed, its input is 1. Hence, the light is on.
 When the input of the timer is 1 and when the environment is dark
If the time is in the range of two pre-arranged ranges the input is 1 and 
otherwise 0. This means, the input is 1 when time is from 6 pm and 6 am, and the 
input is 0 when from 6 am to 6 pm. Further, the light sensor will be 1 when there is light above pre arranged value and it will be 0 when it is dark. Here, the street light will be on when the timer’s input is 1 and light sensor’s value is 0. When the environment is gloomy with a rain cloud, the street light will not be on though the light sensor’s value is 0 if the time is not between 6 am and 6 pm.

 5.1    Introduction to Operating Systems
A Co mputer consists of hardware, firmware and software. 
Any physical component of a computer system with a definite shape is 
called a hardware. Examples of hardware include: mouse, keyboard, display unit, hard disk, speaker, printer etc. 
The booting instructions stored in the ROM (Read Only Memory) are called 
firmware. The initial text information displayed on the screen are displayed by firmware.
How the initial operations of a computer are performed
²When the user powers up the computer the CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
activates the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).
 ²The first program activated is POST (Power On Self-Test). Using the CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) memory this checks all the hardware and confirms that all are functioning properly.
 ²After that it reads the MBR (Master Boot Record) in boot drive in accordance with the firmware ‘bootstrap loader’ which is provided by the computer manufacturer.
²Then the computer loads in the Operating System in boot drive to the RAM (Random Access Memory)
For free distribution 130 ²Once this is performed the Operating System takes over the control of the 
computer and displays a user interface to the user.
This whole process is called booting which means that an Operating System 
is loaded into the RAM (main memory).
Software is a set of instructions given to the computer to perform some 
activity using a computer. There are many types of software. They can be broadly classified as follows:

5.1.1 System Software
1& System Software - System software are generally divided into three types. They
    are:
  a. Operating System – The Operating System provides for the user 
  to utilize the functions of a computer by managing the hardware 
  and software in it. The image 5.2 below depicts how the system 
  software and application software interact with the hardware.

b.Utility Software – These are used to manage and analyze the software 
in the computer. The utility software differ from the application software in their complexity and operational activities. Utility software helps in managing the resources of the computer. However, the application software function in different to the utility software. There are many utility software which dedicated to perform certain functions. Some of them are mentioned below:
i. Anti -Virus Software – to protect the computer from   
virus infections
ii. Disk Formatting – to prepare the storage device in    
order to save the files and folders
c'  Language Translators - A computer program (software) is made  up 
by using a set of instruction codes. These instructions are written in 
high level languages which are very close to the human languages. These high level languages are translated into machine language (i.e 0’s and 1’s) which are understood by the computer by language translators. assembler, compiler and interpreter are examples for language translators.
For free distribution 1325.1.2  Application Software
The application software which runs on the Operating System is used to carry 
out computer based activities of the user such as creating documents, mathematical 
functions, data entry and, computer games.
 Ex: Word processing, spread sheets, database, computer games,    
    Web browsers
5.1.3  Importance of Operating System
The software which facilitate the interaction between human user and 
hardware is the Operating System. The Operating System provides instructions for installation and management of various application software. Not only that the Operating System manages all the input, output and computer memory too, which means that Operating System is the sole software which manages the whole computer system.

is called Apple Macintosh. This Operating System is also a proprietary software which requires payment for license. However, this Operating System can only be installed on Apple computers which are manufactured by Apple Incorporation.
3.
Ubuntu  Operating System
Ubuntu has been developed based on Linux Operating System, This 
Operating System is available free of charge. Hence it is called a Free and Open 
Source Software. We can download Ubuntu free from the URL:  http//www.ubuntu.com
4.
Android  Operating System
Android operating system is developed by Google. This is mainly used for 
the mobile devices. This is also a Free and Open Source Software. 
5.Hanthana  Linux 
This operating system is developed based on Linux operating system and 
can be downloaded free of charge at www.hanthana.org 
For free distribution 1345.1.5  Types of Operating Systems
The main function of an Operating System is to provide an environment 
suitable for executing the commands issued by the user.  Based on the functionality 
of the Operating System it can be classified as:  
1. Single user operating system
2. Multi user operating system
3. Multi-tasking operating system
4. Real time operating system
1. Single user Operating System 
The Operating System which provides service to one person at a time is 
called a Single User Operating System. 
Example - MS Dos Operating System 
2. Multi-User Operating System
The Operating System which allows multiple users to use a system is 
simultaneously called a multi-user operating system. This type of Operating 
System is commonly used in Mainframe or Server computer where several users are connected to a computer system simultaneously. 
Example - Linux, Windows server 
3. Multi-tasking Operating System
The operating system which allows to run multiple process at the same time 
is called a multi-tasking operating system. A single user can run multiple operations 
(tasks) at the same time on this type of operating system.
Example - Windows 7, Windows 8, Ubuntu, Mac Operating System
4. Real Time Operating System  
These are the Operating Systems which gives the output in real time without 
any observable delays. Real Time Operating Systems are mostly utilized in ATM 
end points. Also these kind of Operating Systems are installed in scientific devices and small gadgets. These Operating Systems are specifically designed for particular devices.
Example - ATM machines, Calculators
              For free distribution 1355.1.6  Services of an Operating System
The Operating System is a software which manages the hardware and other 
software in a computer system. It provides services to other software. There are two 
main services performed by an operating system. They are: 
1.  Managing the hardware of a computer2.  Providing user interface
1)  Managing the Hardware of a computer
Hardware of a computer are managed by using the following processes;
i. Process Managementii. Memory Managementiii. Device Managementiv. File Management
v. Security Management
vi. Network Management
Figure 5.4 shows the inter connection between resource management within 
computer.
Figure 5.4 - Resource Management
Let us now consider the above mentioned management tasks;
For free distribution 136i. Process Management 
A user can perform tasks using a computer. Consider the example of printing 
a letter. Eventhough we see the printing of a letter as a single process, it is infact 
performed by dividing the whole process into small tasks within the computer. We call this small task as a process.
 
Figure  5.5 -  Processes Management
We can call a running computer program or part of the program as a process. 
All the activities in a computer run as either a single process or a multiple processes.
Resource management activities such as allocation of CPU time, allocation 
of memory, and allocation of input output devices of each process are managed under the resource management of Operating System.
Odering of the processes (according to a sequence) is also performed under 
management. For example consider keying in some data using the keyboard while a document is being printed. The processor has to prioritize which action has to be performed first. For an observer it appears that both these actions are performed once. Infact, they run as two different processes. Also observe the situation where we make some changes to the document which is in print. Do these changes appear in that document which is being printed? The answer is "No" because these changes which was made after giving the print command do not appear in the printout. This proves that the processes within the computer are performed in certain order.
              For free distribution 137ii. Memory Management
Memory (We specifically talk about RAM – Random Access Memory) 
plays a major role during the functioning of the computer. The input data are 
stored in the RAM before being transferred to the CPU and the processed data i.e. information are also stored in the RAM before being sent to the Output devices. Hence systematic management of the memory is vital for the proper functioning of a computer. Memory management process makes sure that enough memory is allocated for each process and it also makes sure that the memory is freed once a particular process ends. 
Figure  5.6 - Memory Management
The Operating System employs various techniques to memory management. 
We must keep in mind that the Operating System utilizes both the Primary Memory (RAM) and the Secondary Memory efficiently in order to manage the memory for various processes. 
Again consider the example where we type some changes to a word 
document is being printed. Do changes we incorporate to the document are printed? No, it does not. Once the command for print is sent the data are sent to the RAM. Only those data which is in the RAM would be printed. Those changes we add after the ‘print command’ are not printed.
 ²Explain how to find the capacity of Random Access Memory (RAM)
 ²Write down the capasity you use.  Activity

For free distribution 138iii. Device Management
There are several peripheral devices connected to a computer system. The 
operating system is responsible for the management of those devices. Device 
controllers are used to control the peripheral devices whereas device drivers are used to control software components.
Figure  5.7 - Device Management 
For example if you want your newly bought printer to work properly you 
need to install the relevant device driver on the Operating System. If you do not install the driver you may not be able to get the full features of the Printer (such as printing on both sides of the paper, etc).
Today there are devices which work once they are connected (plug and 
play). The relevant device drivers are installed automatically once the device is connected to the computer for the first time. Therefore nowadays the process of installation of the device driver has become easy.
When you connect a printer to a computer, the Operating System installs the relevant device driver automatically. When it does not install automatically we need to manually install it. Find out and write down the steps on how a device driver is installed in your Operating System. Activity

Figure 5.10 - Sequential Access and Random Access
v. Security Management
There are many security threats to a computer. For instance, Malicious 
Software (Malware) such as a virus could harm the smooth functioning of a computer. There could be other threats such as deletion or destruction of data/information by unauthorized access to the system. 
Protecting the computer from these kind of attacks also managed by the 
Operating System up to some extend. Various kinds of techniques are used by the Operating System to perform function.
              For free distribution 141 1. List out and explain each of the methods used by Operating System 
to prevent and control unauthorized access.
2. As Operating System cannot control or mitigate all the threats 
brought in by external malicious software. An Operating System gets 
the support of external (third party) software for this purpose. List out all the threats which are difficult to be controlled by Operating System alone and write down the names of different software which can be used against each of those threats.  Activity
vi. Network Management
Operating Systems support different types of network connectivities. They 
support wired and wireless connectivity for hardware devices in the system such as computers, printers, scanners that exist in the network. 
The Operating System also helps in accessing one computer from a remote 
computer. A computer network facilitates from simple text communication to a multimedia data communication. Today data communication is utilized at a greater scale in networks. This concept is well demonstrated by Cloud Computing. 
 
Figure 5.11 - Computer Network Management
2. Providing user friendly interface
We need an interface to interact with the computer. An Operating System 
provides a user interface to input commands and instructions in a user friendly manner. Using this interface, we can perform tasks without using complex instructions.
There are two types of user interfaces provided by the Operating Systems. 
They are:
For free distribution 1421. Command Line Interface-CLI
2. Graphical User Interface-GUI
The following section discusses in detail about each of the above interfaces.
1. Command Line Interface (CLI)
This kind of interface was used by all the Operating System systems of the 
early days. This interface had a ‘prompt’ where the commands are keyed in using a 
keyboard. In using command line interface, the correct syntax has to be used.

The utility programs in an Operating System
Several processes are performed by the Operating System for the functioning 
of the computer. Many utility programs are available in the Operating System for the functioning of the machine as well as to protect from security threats. In the past we had to buy different utility programs and install whereas nowadays most of the required utilities come with the Operating System.
For free distribution 144There can be many types of utility programs in an Operating System:
• Backup Software - To copy files and take back up of hard drives
• Disk scanner - To check the errors in hard drive
• Disk defragmentation - Organizing the hard disk by rearranging clusters of small 
spaces together and creating a larger free space. This increases the efficiency of the hard disk.
• File/data compression - Compression of larger files into smaller files 
• Task Manager - to display information regarding the processes and programmes in a computer and the general status of the computer
• System diagnosis tools - to monitor errors in hardware and software of a computer or network of computers and diagnosis of system errors.  
• Anti-Virus Software - Protecting the computer by identifying and eliminating malicious software
• Clipboard - temporary storage of data/files for cut/copy and paste operations
• Data synchronization software - to establish consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa
• Disk partitioning software - can divide an individual drive into multiple logical drives
• Screensavers - for blanking the screen or filling it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. 
• System profilers - to provide detailed information about the software installed and hardware attached to the computer.
• Network utilities - to analyze the computer's network connectivity, configure network settings, check data transfer or log events.
In the following section details of some of the utilities in an operating 
system are given:
• Disk Partitioning
• Disk Formatting
• Defragmentation
Disk Partitioning
What is a Partition?
By default there will be only one physical drive in a hard drive.  But this 
drive is normally divided into many logical partitions. This process of dividing an individual drive into multiple logical drives is called disk partitioning.
Normally partitioning is performed at the time when a hard disk is configured 
for the first time. Partitioning could also be performed when a new hard disk is to be added or when an existing hard disk is replaced with a new hard disk.
              For free distribution 145We may need to change the existing partition. When an already partitioned 
hard disk is partitioned again, all the data in that hard disk would be deleted. 
Therefore, it is necessary to keep it a point to keep a backup copy of the existing data before partitioning again.
The following image depicts how a hard disk would look before and after 
partitioning.
          Figure 5.14 - Hard Disk – before and after partitioning
Why do we need partitioning?
There could be many reasons for undertaking partitioning. Below are some 
of the reasons for partitioning.
• When we need to save different items in different places. (Ex: Software in one 
drive and all other data in another drive).
• When we need to have more than one Operating System in the same machine. (Ex: When we need to install both Windows and Ubuntu Operating System)
• To meet the requirement of the Operating System (Ex: Sometimes it becomes mandatory that a separate partition is allocated for the Operating System) 
We can see each of the divided partition as separate drives. In Windows 
environment, it is a customary to name the first drive as C: drive and go on. This means that the First partition becomes the first drive and would be named as C: drive and the second drive would be named as D: drive and so on.
Note: In windows environment, Multimedia drives (DVD, CD), flash drives etc. which are connected to the computer would be identified as ‘Drives’ and they would be named using an English letter after C (after partitioning the hard disk).
For free distribution 146However, in Linux environment all the partitions, multimedia drives, 
flash drives etc. would be identified as individual folders (in Linux they are 
called Directories). Therefore it cannot be seen drives named C: D: etc in Linux environment.
Disk Formatting
A hard disk cannot be used once partitioning is completed. We need to 
format each of the drives individually. 
Formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard 
disk drive, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash drive for storing data. This is done using a file format in the Operating System. 
The USB Flash Drives come pre-formatted so that they can be put into use 
directly. 
We can format hard disk drive, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash 
drive whenever need arises. Every time we perform formatting the data in the drive would be deleted. Therefore it is necessary to keep back up copies of the data before formatting.
Once a hard disk is partitioned and formatted we can start saving data on it.
Usually a hard disk is partitioned and formatted before installing an 
Operating System for the first time. After the first time the need for partitioning or 
formatting could arise very rarely. 
You can see in the image below how a hard disk would look like after 
partitioning and formatting.
    
  
Figure 5.15 – Har Disk – before and after partitioning and formatting
Before partitioning After partitioning After formatting
              For free distribution 147Defragmentation
The following shows the defragment in Windows. Sometimes a file (which 
is larger in size) may not be stored as a single track in the hard disk. This process 
where a single file is broken into different pieces and stored in different parts of the disk is called fragmentation. 
    Figure 5.16 - How a file is stored in different places of a disk
The Operating System splits a file into several portions and saves them 
in different places in the disk especially when a saved file becomes larger due to multiple editing. Further, the empty spaces that are created in the disk due to the deletion of files is used to save new files which causes fragmentation. 
It takes longer time to read a file when a file is defragmented and saved in 
different places in the disk. It affects the efficiency of the computer. 
If you observe a slowness of the machine (there could be many reasons for 
the slowness of the computer, whereas fragmentation could be a one reason) the best action to take would be to start defragmentation.
Disk defragmentation is the process of rearranging the fragmented data on 
a volume (such as a hard disk or a storage device) so it will work more efficiently. 
    
Figure 5.17 - Before Defragmentation             After Defragmentation
However Linux based Operating Systems use a different method to store 
files. Linux Operating System makes sure that ample space is left between the saved files so that they can be saved at the same location as a single intact file even when the file expands due to editing. Therefore there is very little possibility for fragmentation to happen. It is also because Linux based Operating Systems have the ability even to relocate the file in a new place if the file exceeds its allocated memory space. Therefore there is no need for ‘defragmentation utility’ in Linux based Operating Systems.
For free distribution 148 5.2    Introduction to File Systems
Computer is a machine which allows for storage of large volumes of data 
while facilitating the quick retrieval of those saved data when we need. The data we 
save must be given a file name for the purpose of identification. There are many file names used in the storage media which are relevant to a partuclar Operating Systemand Application Software. But all these file names consist of two components, namely file name and file extension. However the file extension are hidden to the user by the Operating System  by default.

Note: The Operating System  identifies the file type using the file extensions.  
There are many file extensions in use. Some of them are listed below:
                 File Extension           File Type
 exe Executable
docx Word
xlsx Excel
pptx PowerPoint
accdb Access
A file name and a location are given when saving a file in the computer. The 
Operating System  maintains many other information relevant to the file. 
Type of file
Size of the FileSaved Date and Time
To view these data, right click on a particular file and then click on 
‘properties’ from the list that appears.

Selecting a location to save a file 
A location is used in the storage space to save a file. It is called a drive. The 
previous section detailed that several drives can exist after partitioning.
Drives
By default a computer uses the hard drive to save. If the hard drive is not 
partitioned then it would be labelled as C: drive. If the hard drive is partitioned then the partitions could be named in order as   [C:], [D:], [E:] etc. 
If there are other storage media such as CD, DVD or Blue Ray Disk drives 
in a computer then these drives are given different letter names. For example if the hard disk is partitioned into four separate partitions then they would be labelled [C:], [D:], [E:]and [F:] drives whereas a CD, DVD or Blue Ray Disk drive would be named as [G:] drive.
              For free distribution 151In the same manner when a pen drive is connected to the computer the new 
drive would be labelled as [K:] drive.  
If you want to see the number of drives in a computer, observe the following 
steps: Open the icon “Computer”. Now you can see, the externally connected drives 
such as Blue Ray Disk drives and pen drives are shown as devices with removable storage.  
Figure 5.21 - - Viewing the drives
Even though we use the drives to store the files, in general they are not 
directly stored to the drive. Usually we create a folder in a drive and then store the file it in. We should give a name to the folder in order to identify the folders too. 
Creating a Folder  
1. Select the drive where the folder to be created.
2. Now select 'Folder' under 'New' in 'File Menu' or 'New folder' under      'Tools'.3. Provide a suitable folder name

use the type writer in the library”, was another suggestion.
“We should find attractive types of letters and  add pictures. A border will give 
a good finish. A typewriter won’t provide such facilities, will it?” Everybody is confused. You need to find a solution for this problem.
We often use different types of documents in our day-to-day activities and 
preparing these documents in different styles is called word processing. In order to avoid the shortcomings of preparation of pen or pencil in based documents, typewrites were used in the early days. Even though such typed documents were better than the hand written documents, manual typewriters do not allow functions such as formatting, saving, printing in required sizes. 
The computer is the best machine for such an activity. A word processing 
software can provide the following faclities;
 ²Creation and editing
 ²Insert objects such as images
 ²Saving and retrieving
 ²Print preview and printing
 ²Spell checking and grammar
 ²Find and replace 
 ²Mail merge

Electronic waste (e-waste): what is it 
and how do we get rid of it ?This term applies to consumer and 
business electronic equipment that is near or at the end of its useful life There is no clear definition for electronic waste (e-waste) at this time, but if you can plug it in an electricaloutlet or it contains circuit boards or chips, it is most likely e-waste. These products can contain heavy metals like cadmium, lead, copper, and chromium that can contaminate the environment Do NOT dispose of these items in the trash or your recycling bins.
Examples of electronic waste include, but not limited to :
  TVs, computer monitors, Printers, Scanners, Keyboards, mice, cables, circuit boards, lamps, clocks, flashlight, calculators, phones, answering machines, digital / video cameras, radios, VCRs, DVD players, MP3 and CD players.
  Kitchen equipment (toasters, coffee makers, microwave evens)
  Laboratory equipment (hot plates, microscopes, calorimeters)
  Broken computer monitors, television tubes (CRTs)
Student E - waste Recycling Options
Any laboratory equipment that has the 
possibility of being contaminated with chemical, biological, or radioactive substances must be cleared through EH&S and Departmental Facilities Office before disposal. If you live on - campus you can dispose of your electronic waste easity and conveniently by creating a Fix It Ticket or contacting your college maintenance office.If you live off - campus, learn more about the Sants Cruz County electronic waste disposal program:
Additional information on disposal / recycling of e-waste and other 
regulated items can be found in all college mailrooms, Graduate Student Housing Mailroom and the Village Laundry Community room. Multibins are blue cabinets built to collect batteries, small electronics, printer cartideges, and CDs. They are located in every college mailroom.

 7.1      Introduction
Perhaps in our day-to-day life or at work we need to perform calculations. 
We use various methods to perform such calculations. Depending on the nature 
of calculations we use our fingers or mental calculations to perform simple calculations while we use calculators or paper based systems to compute complex calculations. In order to do calculations easily and accurately let us learn how electronic spreadsheets can be used. 
We usually use a square ruled book to perform systematic calculations.  
Every page in this book consists of pages with rows and columns. Electronic Spreadsheets which consist of multiples of rows and columns based on this model of square ruled books.
              For free distribution 191Using Electronic Spreadsheets we can accurately and efficiently perform 
the following activities:
• Simple and complex calculations
• Presentation of data in charts• Show data in ascending and descending order• Segregate only the required data• Check the validity of data• Protection of data using passwords
• Saving for future use

For free distribution 2027.3.2  Formulas with cell addresses and operators
 
 The main advantage of entering formulae using cell addresses and operators 
is when the values of the cells concerned change, the results obtained by the 
formulae also get updated accordingly. 
Example 1
In order to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle, let us enter the length and breadth of the rectangle in cells A2 and B2 respectively. The formulae to derive the perimeter are entered in cells C2,C3,C4 and the formula to derive the area is entered in cell D2. See Figure 7.13
     Figure 7.13 - The perimeter and area of a rectangle
     Activity 
Create a worksheet in your spreadsheet application based on the image 7.13. Observe the changes in values obtained from the formulae in column C and D when you enter different values in cells A2 and B2.
Important: In cell D2 if you write the formula D2=A2*B2 it would be taken as a label and hence calculations do not happen. Therefore it is important to remember that nothing should be written on the left side of the equal sign (‘=’). (See image 7.15).

When there is a large quantity of data it becomes a difficult and complex 
task to write formulae using only the cell addresses. In this kind of situation 
functions are used. The spreadsheet applications contain different functions to meet the requirements of different fields. Let us learn some of basic functions which are commonly used. (See table 7.8)
Table 7.8
Name 
of function Syntax             Use
SUM =SUM(Number1,Number2......) Adds the values contained in a range of cells.
A VERAGE 
=A VERAGE(Number1,Number2.......) Finds out the average of the values contained in a range of cells.
 MAX
=MAX(Number1,Number2.......) Finds out the largest value contained in a range of cells.
 MIN
=MIN(Number1,Number2......) Finds out the smallest value contained in a range of cells.
COUNT
=COUNT(Number1,Number2.....) Counts the number of cells within a range of cells.
 
  
For example, look at the methods 1 and 2 given below. In order to find out the 
sum of the values of cells A1 to A10, method 1 uses cell addresses whereas method 2 uses a function. The same results are obtained from both methods. However, when there is a large range of cells, the formula shown by method 2 is simple and easy compared to both the methods.

7.6.5  Relative and absolute cell reference
A cell address (reference) consists of a column letter and a row number. In a 
formula such a cell address is always called as a relative reference. The dollar sign ($) when sign is placed before a row number absolute row is obtained, when ($) mark is placed before a column name an absolute column is obtained, when ($) is placed before column name and row uumber absolute column and row absolute can be obtained.
Example
H2 - Relative cell reference
H$2  - Row absolute cell reference$H2 - Column absolute cell reference$H$2 - Row and column absolute cell reference
7.6.6  Relative cell reference
If the row number and the column letter of the adjacent cells change 
accordingly when a formula is copied, such cell addresses are called relative cell 
reference.
For free distribution 220Example
When the formula A1+B1 entered in C1 is dragged down along column C and 
dragged sideways along row 1, the cell references change accordingly as shown in image 7.33 below. Hence the cell references A1 and B1 could be considered relative cell reference.

Column letters change
Row numbers change
7.6.7  Row absolute cell reference
If the row number of the cells remain unchanged when a formulae is dragged 
sideways along a row, it is called row absolute cell reference.
ExampleWhen the formula= A$1+ B$1 entered in C1, and is dragged down along column C 
and dragged sideways along row 1, as shown 7.34 only the column letters change relatively while the row numbers remain unchanged. Hence the cell reference A$1 and B$1 can be called row absolute cell reference.
Column letters change
Row numbers remain

See worksheet 7.35 where the price of many pencils are derived when we know the 
price of the pencil. 
Figure 7:35 - Relative and absoute cell reference  
=A2*B2 is the formula we need to enter in C2 to calculate the price of pencils along the column C relative to the number of pencils. Note that we cannot calculate the price of pencils by copying along column C. When the formula is being copied A2 should relatively change into A3,A4,A5 etc. But the cell B2 should always remain constant within the formula. Hence the correct formula to be written in cell C2 is = A2*B$2.
7.6.8  Column absolute cell reference
If the column letter of the cells remain unchanged when a formula is dragged 
down along a column, it is called column absolute cell reference.
Example 1 
When the formula = $A1+$B1 entered in C1 is dragged down along column C and 
dragged sideways along row 1, as shown in figure 7.36 only the row numbers change relatively while the column letters remain unchanged. Hence the cell reference $A1 and $B1 can be called column absolute cell reference.
Column letters remain 
Row numbers change Figure 7.36 - Worsksheet with column absolute cell reference.

When the formula is copied along row 3 it would appear as shown in figure 7.38 below.
Figure 7.38 - Worsksheet with column absolute cell reference 
including formulae 
7.6.9  Row and column absolute cell reference
If the row numbers and column letters of the cells remain unchanged when 
a formula is dragged sideways along a row, such cell addresses are known as row and column absolute cell reference.
Example 1When the formula =A$1+$B$1 in C1 is copied along column A and row 1, the cell 
references do not change as shown in worksheet figure 7.39
Column letters remain unchanged 
Row numbers remain unchanged.

copied along a row or column, the references within the cell remain unchanged.
Example 2As per worksheet in figure 7.40, the prices of books as per quantity are to be 
calculated from D4 to 14 and prices of books as per the number of dozens are to be calculated from C5 to C10. Let us write all the formulas so that the relevant prices are displayed at once when we enter the unit price of a book in cell C1. We have C1 has to remain unchanged when the formula is copied along row 4 and along C. Hence we have to enter $C$1, within the relevant formula.

Amara     :- Shyama, for this year’s ICT day, our teacher suggested that we make a  
     Presentation which portrays the history of our school and also how
        ICT is used in our school.
Shyama   :-  Amara, then what do we do for it?
Amara      :-  I think we all must get together and make a good presentation. Then we 
                                                        can show it at the auditorium during the event using the new multimedia
           projector.
Shyama  :- That’s a good idea. We can even take photographs and videos of the
     school using the teacher’s digital camera and insert them too into the       presentation. 
Amara     :-   Yes, Shyama. Not only that we can animate the school emblem, the flag
         etc and make beautiful slides too. 
Shyama   :-  Also we can give print outs of the presentation to the guests. Can we?
Amara       :-  Yes, Shyama.. Let’s go to the teacher right now and get his ideas on how
        to make a good presentation. By completing this lesson you will acquire a sound understanding of:
•   what is a presentation
•   the characteristics of a good presentation• creating an attractive multi-media presentation using the basic tools of 
      presentations software•   slide background, slide templates, slide layout planning •   inserting suitable images or pictures into slides of presentation, •   inserting animations into slides. 
              For free distribution 2318.1   What is meant by ‘presentation?
People make presentation to share their views, opinions, ideas  and  
knowledge with a larger group of people. During this process they may use different 
techniques, methods, gestures and tools to impart knowledge and to justify one’s points to the audience. 
The Slide Projector and Overhead Projector 
(OHP) were common tools for presentation. The mechanism of overhead projector (See image 8.1.1) is different to that of a slide projector. The transparent sheets used in a overhead projector have to be  
pre-prepared. But notes can be written on the transparent sheet using a pen even when the presentation is going on. However the contents of the transparent sheet once made cannot be erased and used again. Also it cannot present a video or an audio. Since this was a simple device the presenters widely used the OHP’s to do effective presentations.  
 A completely different process has to be 
followed in order to make the slides required for a slide projector. The images taken by a camera have to be prepared in a lab and fixed on to the slides. Here too, one cannot include audio or video in the slides.  But with the advent of computer technology 
video cameras and multimedia projectors have become common tools of presentation today. 
The advantages of the multimedia projector is that we can display the 
presentations which are made quickly using a computer, and the ability to include multimedia contents such as audio and video. We can include multimedia contents such as numbers, letters, pictures, graphics, images, movies and videos, tables and graphs, voice and sound in a presentation. Since this presentation contains multiple types of contents, it is called a multimedia electronic presentation. 
The multimedia projector which was 
bulky in the early days is becoming smaller in size with many new features. Figure 8'1'1 - OHP

For free distribution 2328.2   The characteristics of a good quality presentation  
We need a good quality presentation in order convey the message clearlry 
to the audience. We can improve the quality of a presentation by paying attention to 
its contents. Hence, let us look at the features to which we need to pay attention to improve the quality of a presentation. 
∗  Number of lines
  It is important to consider the number of lines, as same as font size. The 
most appropriate number of lines per slide are 6-9. If more than that are added, 
it may take more time to read or font size may become too small.
∗  Font-size
The distance between the screen and the audience is an important factor 
     to decide on the font size of the texts of a presentation. It is an accepted norm       to keep the font size at 32 points or more. It is easier for the audience to read the      contents of such font size.  
Think of a presentation you had watched; how many of these points were considered there? Pay attention to these features when you watch  presentations in the future.
∗Correct use of grammar and language
It is a must that you double check the grammar, spellings and use of  language 
by reading the slides carefully. 
∗Inserting images, drawings, tables or graphs
  It is not suitable to insert more than two images, drawings, tables or graphs 
in each slide. It may become confusing if we insert too many images, drawings, 
tables or graphs in one slide. Activity
 1.  Make a list of features how traditional presentation differ from  
    electronic presentation   and compare their pros and cons. Also point  
       out how you can use the electronic presentations in your educational  
      activities. 2.    Make a list of all possible multimedia contents which can be included  
      in a e-presentation.
    electronic presentation   and compare their pros and cons. Also point 
       out how you can use the electronic presentations in your educational 

              For free distribution 233∗ Use of colours
  The use of colours in a presentation is a very important factor. We can use 
dark colours, bold letters or use of different fonts to emphasize certain points. 
The use of dark red colour throughout the slide is a not a good practice since it may be uncomfortable for the viewers’ eyes. But you can use red for some words, numbers, points etc which need attention. It is important to pay attention to the contrast of background and foreground colours also. 
∗Animation and videos
  It is ideal to use one animation or video in each slide. If you use more than 
one, the overlap of sounds may cause confusion to the viewer. 
∗Pay attention on target group
  When using multimedia it is important to pay attention to meeting the 
objectives of the target audience. We have to prepare the contents of a presentation such that it does not divert the attention of the audience away from the objectives. Otherwise, the viewer may lose the attention. For example if the audience’s attention is attracted towards a particular animation included in the slide, the whole objective of the presentation might be lost.

Green computing ...
 Green computing is the study and practice of designing, manufacturing, 
using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems — such as 
monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment.The environmental effects of computing should be addressed Green use, green disposal, green design, and green manufacturing. Green computing can also develop solutions that offer benefits by aligning all IT processes and practices with the core principles of sustainability, which are to reduce, reuse, and recycle; and finding innovative ways to use IT in business processes to deliver sustainability benefits across the enterprise and beyond.  Modern IT systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment. There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption.

²   advantages of using a database²   special characteristics of a database²   using fields to create tables²   identifying key fields²   relational databases²   relationships between tables²   using queries to get data²   using data forms²   using reports to furnish information
 9.1   Database Concept
Chapter one included a description on what data and information are. This 
chapter covers saving data in an organized manner. 
Higher the amount of data it becomes difficult to keep in our memory. On 
such occasions writing these data is one method. That is called manual database. 
The other method is to maintain the data on an electronic medium. This is called an electronic database. Data can be retrieved efficiently when needed if it is saved on a database in a systematic way. Hence, the database is needed to save a large amount of data and to retrieve them very efficiently.9   Database
For free distribution 252Examples 
It would be easy for you to remember names of your friends, but it would be difficult to retain all their phone numbers in your memory. You can get these details easily when needed if you write names and phone numbers in a book (Figure 9.1) or save them in a mobile phone (Figure 9.2). Thus, the phone book can be considered a simple database. 
Defining a Database  - Collection of organized data can be defined as a database
9.1.1  Advantages of Databases
   ²     More efficient in retriving  information.
Required information can be found very quickly as data is properly 
organized in tables in a database.
 ² Easy to obtain copies.
     Electronic databases can be copied very easily.
 ² Smaller physical space to store data.
     Though  more physical space is needed to maintain a manual 
     database, a small space is sufficient to save data on an electronic medium.
 ² Data analysis can be carried out efficiently.
Only the necessary data can be selected and processed.
 ² Data can be shared.
The same database can be used in different application software.
 ² Independence of data.
     Though database and software are connected, database 
  tables can be updated without changes to the application software.     Therefore, data and software are independent.

•   Minimal data redundancy
If the same data is stored in several tables, this is called data redundancy. 
For instance, the name of a student may be recorded separately in the 
admission card and the library membership card.  When a name is changed, that 
name should be edited separately in all documents. Given below is an example where the name ‘Firosa Lai’ is changed as ‘Firosa Rafeeq’.

However, by storing related database in tables, data redundancy can be 
minimized. In the following table, a student name is recorded only in one table.

 ²Data consistency : By minimizing data redundancy, the same data being saved in various tables can be reduced or prevented. This enables to maintenance of data consistency.
If you consider the example above, student data, data about books and 
    usage of books are saved separately in different tables. As such data such as           name of a student or a book should be recorded only once. Thus, data consistency       is maintained. 
²  Increases efficiency : Since database tables are properly organized, saving
      and reading data can be carried out efficiently. Hence, efficiency is higher.
As per example above, let us consider the change of name from Firosa 
    Lai to Firosa Rafeeq. If the same data (Firosa Lai) are recorded in different 
    tables, more time is spent to find all these places. This leads to inefficiency.    However, in related databases data consistency increases speed. Hence,      efficiency is increased. 
²       Increases accuracy  :  Since data redundancy can be minimized in a database, data
       consistency is maintained. This increases accuracy.    
Let us consider the example above where Firosa Lai is changed to Firosa 
    Rafeeq. If several places are corrected, one mistake would lead to inaccurate 
     information.       
              For free distribution 255    However, in the above database only one table is need to be updated to 
change Firosa Lai to Firosa Rafeeq. This ensures data consistency. Therefore, the accuracy of data is very high.
²  Increases validity : Properties of fields can be assigned when a database     is planned. Validity can be checked at the data entry stage. This increases the     validity of the database.
                    For instance, field attributes can be imposed as fees to be indicated in 
two decimals with minimum fees being 1000 which is mandatory.          
        
Figure 9.3 - Properties of  data type
²  Security : Unauthorized access can be controlled by using a password 
   and encypting the database. This increases security.
  Data encrypting is translating data in such a way that unauthorized personnel 
cannot read it.  In the following figure 9.4, data available in Employee table are 
encripted so as it cannot be understood by an unauthorized person.

Five details related to each student are given above. Thus, data such as 
Kavindu Prabashwara, Meenadevi Ramanathan, Mohommad Malikkar represent 
one field. To name such a field, a ‘field name’ is used.
Let us create a table recording details under each field name. (Table 9.6)

A column of the table represents one field. Thus, the above table consists of 
five fields. They are admission number, Name, Data or Birth, Gender and Telephone number.
A collection of fields makes a record. Hence, the  above table has three records.
              For free distribution 259There is the possibility of entering the same data again in the columns 
such as Name, Date of Birth, Gender and Tel No. However, a datum entered in the 
column of Admission No will not be repeated. Hence, the field Admission No is more suitable to uniquely identify a record. 
What are the books borrowed by Firosa Rafeeq? Let us learn how this is 
found in relevent tables.

9.1.6  Composite Primary Key
The primary key which consists of two or more columns of a table uniquely  
identifies a record is called Composite Primary Key.
Look at the table given below about the captain and vice captain of a school.

2014 Cricket Mubharak Husein Bhanu Dayarathne
2014 Football Jaliya Saranga Ahammed Nawas2014 V olleyball Bhathiya Gamlath Sudesh Tharanga
 
Composite KeyBoth the year and sport are needed to uniquely identify 
a record.
   Example
Table 9.9 – Sports Table  
For free distribution 262 Since the column data of this table containes duplicate. There is no single 
column to uniquely identify records. There should be a definite captain and a vice 
captain for a sport in a year. Hence, as far as the combination of two columns; year and sport is considered, identity of records exists. Hence, combination of both fields ‘year’ and ‘sport’ can be considered as the primary key. The composite key made of the combination of these two columns is suitable for the primary key in this table. When indicating the composite primary key, fields are separately underlined. (Refer Table 9.10)
          Table 9.10
Year Sport Captain Vice Captain
The composite primary key of this table = Year + Sport 
9.1.7  Foreign Key 
 If a field (or a combination of fields) of one table can be used to uniquely 
identify rows of another table, this/these field/s is/are called the foreign key.This key builds connection of two tables.
Table 9.11 –  Student Table 
When considering the tables 9.11 and 9.12, Registration Number is the primary key of 9.11 - Student Table where as Registration Number is the foreign key of 9.12 - Subject Table. Further, a separate primary key is available for subject table and that is candidate number.Registration

Recording column data repeatedly is called data duplication.
Disadvantages of data duplication
(i)   Inability to select a primary key field to maintain identity of records.
(ii)  Inability to analyse data properly.
Though the number of students who have scored above 60 marks is 5 as per 
the above table, the actual number of students in the class is 3. Hence, a proper data analysis cannot be done.observation 
 Special features of a foreign key
•  Builds a connection between two tables.• The related data of the primary key field exist in the other  
     table.
•  Foreign key of one table is the primary key of the other table.

For free distribution 264(iii)  Reduced efficiency
  When entering marks of several years in the above table, more time is spent 
  to enter the admission number, name and date of birth of the same student. 
  This reduces efficiency.
(iv)  Possibility to get inaccurate data is high.  There can be errors in entering the same data repeatedly. Mohommad 
  Malikkar can be recorded as Mohommad Malakkar in another place. These 
  mismatches can lead to inaccurate data. Hence, accuracy becomes low.
(v)   Difficult to input data.  To enter the marks of a student, his/her name and date of birth should be 
  entered repeatedly.
(vi)  Possibility to make errors in deleting data.  As there are several records related to a student, there can be errors in 
  deleting data.
(vii)  Difficult to update data.  As there are several records related to one student, attention should be paid to
  each record in updating it.
These difficulties are created as all data are stored in one table. Hence, to 
minimize such difficulties, a table can be divided into several tables.
Let us create two tables: Student Table and Marks Table, by removing the 
fields which cause data duplication.
Let us create Student Table (Table 9.15) which consists of Admission Number, 
Name and Date of Birth.
In the Student Table, there is the possibility of data in Name and Date of 
Birth fields being duplicated. However, data does not duplicate under Admission Number. Hence, Admission Number is more suitable to identify records uniquely. Therefore, the primary key of the Student Table is the Admission Number.

              For free distribution 265Let us create a Marks Table (Table 9.16) which consists of the Admission 
Number, Marks, Term and Year.

1427 68 2 2014
1428 66 2 2014
There is only one datum in the Student Table related to Admission Number 
of Marks Table.
Hence, the field of the Admission Number is the primary key of the Student 
Table and foreign key of the Marks Table.
9.2  Creating a Simple Database Manually
Data type : a type of data related to one field is called a data type. Let us learn about
      some commonly used data type.
 ²Numeric: used for calculations. Exists in several forms.
∗Integer: plus or minus whole numeric figures.
   E.g.: 12, -23
∗Real: plus or minus numbers with decimal places.
   E.g.: 8.125, -2.64, 4.00    
 ²text: composed of letters, numbers or special characters (Eg-  %, *, -). Though 
numbers are used, it is not used for calculations.  
E.g.: National identity card number –889534731V
          Telephone number –0112785123, 0112 - 985123
 ²Currency: used to indicate monetary values.
  E.g.: $12.45, Rs.35.00
 ²Date / Time: indicates dates and time
   E.g.: 12/23/2013, 7.35 a.m
 ²Boolean: there are only two Boolean (logical) values; True and False.  
The size of a field can be changed according to the data type and number of 
data input to that field. 
For free distribution 266E.g.: Field Name (Column Name)               Number of fields (Column Width)
             Subject Name                                            15             Subject Code                                              5
Data type related to the field should be identified when the table is created.

Let us learn electronic databases with the purpose of  converting a manual 
database to an electronic medium. 
Definition
A collection of objects which facilitates planning and maintenance of the 
database to the user is called a Database Management System (DBMS). This consists of several objects like tables, queries, forms and reports. (Refer Figure 9.7)

according to the operating system.
2. Planning a Data Table
Open database software and plan a table with the fields and data types as 
given in 9.8. Name the table as ‘Library’.
3. Creating the Primary Key for a Data Table 
Data should not be duplicated to uniquely identify rows of a table. Identity 
of records can be maintained by using a column or a combination of columns of a 
table as a primary key field. Convert the field of ‘Accession Number’ in the above figure 9.8 to the primary key field.For Microsoft OfficeAccess'''

You have studied the Primary Key and Foreign Key of a table in unit 9.1. 
Rather than keeping all the data in a single table, it is easier, more efficient and 
productive to input, update and delete data if those are recorded separately in different tables. Hence, let us study this section well to break a data table into several simple tables and to build relationships between these.
When creating a relational databases, several type of relations can exist 
among tables. They are known as one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.
9.4.2 One-to-one Relationship
If only a row of a table is related to a row of another table, it is called a 
one-to-one relationship.
Two tables exist as A and B.  A row in table A is related to one row in Table 
B and a row in Table B is related to one row in Table A. 
ExampleGiven below is Table 9.19 which includes the marks students scored of the Grade 
5 scholarship exam.

Table. A record of the Student Table is related to only one record of the Marks Table 
as well.
The primary key of the Student Table is the Admission Number and it is the 
foreign key of the Marks Table. The Primary key of the Marks Table is the Index Number. The relationship built between these two tables through the foreign key is one-to-one. (Figure 9.11)

9.4.2  One-to-many Relationship
If each record of a table is related to several records of the other table, this 
is called a one-to-many relationship. 
If the tables are A and B, and if B is the related table, the following Table 
9.22  shows one-to-many relationship.Student Table

In this table, the fields 'Payment Date' and 'Fees' depend on the Field Receipt 
Number. Further, data is unique in the Receipt Number Field. The reason for this is that receipt numbers will not be same. Anyway, there can be incomplete records in the table as receipts should be issued in the order of payment. (Indicated as R in the table) Further, data duplication can also be seen here.
Hence, let us break this table into two tables: Table 9.24 –Student Table and 
9.25 – Fees Table.
The Receipt Number is the primary key of the Fees Table. Admission 
Number is the primary key of the Student Table and the Foreign Key of the Fees Table.Table 9.22 – Features of a one-to-many relationship

• If number of records is 0, this means fee is not paid.• If number of records is 1, this means fee is paid once only.• If number of records is 2, this means fee is paid twice.• If number of records is 3, this means fee is paid thrice.
Thus, there can be no or several rows in the Fees Table related to a

 Special Features in Related Tables
 As soon as the values of a primary key field of the Student Table are updated 
using 'Referential Integrity,' the foreign key field values of the related table are automatically changed. Further, when a record of the Student Table is deleted, the related records of 
the related table are automatically deleted. First, data should be entered to the student Table. After that, data can be 
entered to the Marks Table. After entering the marks to the Student Table, data can be entered to the 
Marks Table through it.  For this, click on the + mark which is in front of the Admission Number of 
the Student Table. Then data can be entered to Marks Table easily. (Refer Figure 9.19)

forms are used to display entered data as well.  
Here, a row of a table is displayed and entered as a record in a form. (Refer 
Figure 9.18) 
Each input record is entered to the last column of the table. Each record of 
the table can be filled one by one through the form. For this, the Record Navigation Bar of a form is used. (Refer Figure 9.20)Data Table

As shown in Figure 9.28, marks scored by students in 2013 and 2014 are 
shown. You can obtain marks scored by students in 2014 only (information shown 
in Figure 9.28) by naming year 2014 as Criteria. (Refer Figure 9.29)
Various calculations can be made using fields through query. Let us learn 
how total marks scored by students are calculated. 
Add a new column to the query as Total and build an expression indicating 
the calculation needed.  To get total marks of subject it should be typed as:

typed (Refer Figure 9.31.) or can be performed by building the expression, right 
click the Mouse button on the column which you expect to get the total and select Build command. Then use the Dialogue Box you get. (Refer Figure 9.32)

9.8 Designing Reports to Present Information
Reports are used to obtain printed copies of important information received 
from the data of related tables. Both tables and queries can be used to design reports.
Let us learn how a report is designed using the query given above in Figure 9.33.Report Wizard can be used to design reports.

Create Tab → Report Wizard → Select the necessary table or query (Refer Figure 9.34) → 
Select the fields needed for the report from the table or query → Design the report as you need 
clicking Next button → Finish. Then you will get a report as shown in Figure 9.35.

Let us learn how numerical values included in a report are calculated. 
For this, let us find the total of admission fees paid by the students. Create a 
table as explained above using Report Wizard including Admission Number, Name 
and Admission Fees. Then change from Report View to Design View. Then you will get a report layout as shown in Figure 9.36.
