For free distribution 1  After studying this chapter, you will understand the following:
 ²How to analyze a problem and develop an algorithm
 ²Control structures and their use
 ²Drawing flow charts, writing pseudo codes and conversions between them
 ²Finding alternate solutions to a problem
 ²Programming in Pascal
 ²Evolution of programming languages
1.1  Analyzing a problem
  The raw materials that are used to solve a problem are known as the 'input'. 
The result obtained after solving a problem is known as the 'output'. Converting 
input to output is called the 'process'. A process takes place step by step and it is very important to understand the order of the process. When analyzing a problem, the input, process and output are identified separately. 
Example -
 
Problem 1 : Preparing a letter which can be posted.
 Input :    A sheet of paper suitable to write the letter on and a pen  
       An envelope and a stamp                                
       Glue
 Process :  1. Writing the letter      
   2. Folding the letter and putting it into 
       the envelope   3. Pasting the envelope   
   4. Writing the recipient's address on the  
       envelope     
   5. Sticking the stamp
 Output :  A letter ready to be posted.
 Note:   Steps No. 4 and 5 in this process can be interchanged.  
   However, the other steps should be followed in the order  
   indicated. 1 Programming

Problem 2 : Making a cup of tea
Input :   Tea leaves, sugar, hot water
Process :  1. Putting tea leaves in the strainer
     2. Pouring hot water to the cup through  
       the strainer  
     3. Adding some sugar to the cup
     4. Stirring it well with a spoon
    5. Testing for taste, taking a small sip from the cup
     6. If the taste is not satisfactory, go to step 3 and repeat step
       Nos. 4 and 5
Output :  A cup of tea
Problem 3 :  Dividing 40 page and 80 page books from a parcel of 
              books between two siblings - Sanduni and Anupama.
Input :  The parcel of books
Process :  1. Opening the book parcel     2. Taking a book out from the parcel 
     3. If it is a 40 page book, giving it to 
        Sanduni
     4. If it is a 80 page book, giving it to  
       Anupama
     5. Go to Step No. 2 till all the books are taken out of the 
       parcel
Output :  Sanduni getting 40 page books     Anupama getting 80 page books
Problem 4 : Adding two numbers 
Input :  Two numbers 
Process :  Adding the two numbers
Output :  Total
Problem 5 :  Finding the area of a rectangle 
Input :  Length and width of the rectangle
Process :  Area = Length x Width
Output :  Area
For free distribution 3
Problem 6 : Finding the larger number between two numbers
Input :  Two numbers
Process :  Comparing the two numbers, finding the larger one
Output :  Larger number
Problem 7 :  Finding whether a number is odd or even
Input :   Number
Process :  Dividing the number by 2
      Deciding that the number is even if 
   the remainder = 0      Deciding that the number is odd if the remainder = 1
Output :  Indicating whether the number is odd or even
Activity  
1. Identify the input, process and output related to dividing 100 toffees 
among 20 people.
2. Identify the input, process and output in making a kite. 
What are alternative solutions?
If there is more than one solution to a given problem, such solutions are 
called alternative solutions. Such solutions depend on the nature of the problem. 

4
 For free distributionExample  
Imagine you come to school by school bus. If the bus breaks down on your way to 
school, you certainly will think of other alternative ways to reach school. Thus, you will think of  alternative solutions to reach school.
1. Coming to school by another school bus which goes to your school
2. If you have money, reaching the school by CTB or private bus3. Walking to school along the road4. Walking to school using a short-cut5.If you have a way to inform your parents, get their support to reach the 
school
6.Reaching the school by car or motor bike with the support of a trustworthy person
You may select a good solution out of these if it is mandatory to go to school that day. 
Thus, if there are many solutions (set) to a particular problem, it is suitable to 
consider these and select an appropriate solution.
All the solutions pertaining to a problem are called solution space. In computer 
programming also, various solutions should be identified and an appropriate 
solution should be selected. Then, we can create a short, simple program.
Example 1 
Let us examine the solution space to find the perimeter of a rectangle.Let us analyze the input, process and output related to this problem.
Input     : Length and width of the rectangleProcess : Calculating the perimeterOutput  : Indicating the perimeter
Let us examine the solution space to calculate the perimeter.
1st solution       Perimeter = length + width + length + width 2nd solution       Perimeter = length × 2 + width × 23rd solution       Perimeter = (length + width) × 2
Out of these solutions, a person who has knowledge only of addition, can select the 
1st solution as the most appropriate. A person who has knowledge of multiplication and addition can select the 3rd solution out of the 2nd and 3rd solutions  as the most appropriate. The reason for this is, it has the minimum number of additions and multiplications. 
For free distribution 5Example 2 
Indicating that a student has failed if the score for the ICT Subject is less than 35, 
and indicating pass if the score is 35 or above.
Input : Marks
Process : Comparing the mark scored with 35
  Solution 1.  If the mark is less than 35
    Result = Fail        If not
          Result = Pass
  Solution 2.  If the mark is 35 or more than 35         Result = Pass
          If not 
          Result = Fail
Output : Fail or Pass
Example 3 Finding the larger number from the given two numbers (See problem 6 in page 3)
Let us consider the two input numbers as n1 and n2.
  Solution 1.  If n1 is larger than n2, the larger number will be  n1. 
         If n2 is larger than n1, the larger number will be n2.
  Solution 2.  Subtract n2 from n1.
          If the result is more than 0, n1 is the larger number.
                    If the result is less than 0, n2 is the larger number.
Thus, it is important to select the appropriate solution out of the available alternative 
solutions.

 For free distribution1.2  Problem Solving using Algorithms
An algorithm is a method to show the steps in solving a problem.  An 
algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The need for this is to 
present a way to solve the problem with a plan.
Example 1 - Let us develop an algorithm to post a letter.
(1) Writing the letter(2) Folding the letter(3) Inserting the letter in an envelope(4) Writing the address(5)  Sticking the stamp(6) Posting the letter
Step (1), (2) and (3) in this algorithm should be followed in the given order. 
Step (4) and (5) can be interchanged. The reason for this is, you can either stick the 
stamp after writing the address or write the address after sticking the stamp. 
Thus, there are steps in an algorithm which should be followed in a strict 
sequential order. Sometimes, if the order of some steps is changed, it does not affect the process and the output is same.
Example 2 - Let us consider steps in measuring 500g of sugar using a scale.   
(1) Putting sugar into a bag(2) Placing the bag on the scale and getting the reading on the 
scale
(3) If the weight of the sugar is less than 500g, add sugar till 
it weighs 500g
(4) If the weight of the sugar is more than 500g, remove sugar from the bag till it weighs 500g
(5) Remove the bag of sugar from the scale when the weight is 500g
The algorithm to measure 500g sugar is given above.
Activity  
There are 183 students in a primary school. The principal has decided to hold an inter-house sports meet dividing them into three houses – Olu, Nelum and Manel. Develop an algorithm to the divide the students into the three houses.
For free distribution 71.2.1  Control Structures
Three types of control structures are used in an algorithms.
  i.    Sequence      
  ii.   Selection      
  
  iii.  Repetition     
i. Sequence 
If the steps from the beginning to the end of an algorithm are carried out in 
a strict order, it is called a sequence.
Example -
1.  Climbing up or down step by step when going on a staircase
2. Students who were admitted to grade 1 of the school  
     continue studies till grade 13
Activity  
Write down two incidents which consist of sequences.
ii. Selection 
Selection is a situation where step(s) are executed depending on whether a 
condition of an algorithm is satisfied or not. There are two choices; if the condition 
is satisfied, one is selected and if it is not satisfied, the other selection is selected.
8
 For free distributionExamples of selection
1. Admitting a child to Grade 1:
   If a child is below 5 years as at 31st of           
 January that year
      The child cannot be admitted to school
      If not
      The child can be admitted to school
2. Passing a subject:
If the mark is 35 or more
      It is a Pass
      If not      It is a Fail
   3.   Buying a book:
  If you have money equal to or more than  
  the price of the book
        You can buy the book        If not        You cannot buy the book
Activity 
1. Write down three incidents which consist of selection.2. If a Sri Lankan citizen gets the right to vote after completing the age 
of 18, select the most suitable word for the blanks given below.
If the age is ……………… (more/less) than 18
 The vote ……………… (can/cannot ) be castedIf not, The vote …………… (can/cannot) be casted
iii. Repetition
If one or several steps of an algorithm are repeated until a condition is 
satisfied, it is called repetition.
For free distribution 9Examples
1.Let us consider the process of a class teacher 
marking the attendance register.
(1)   Call the first name on the register
(2)   Mark 1 if the student is present(3)   Mark 0 if the student is absent(4)   Call the name of the next student(5)   Repeat step (2) or (3) and (4)  till the  
        last name of the register is called
2.Let us consider the process of reading a paragraph and calculating the number of words you read.
(1)   Read the first word of the paragraph
(2)   Number of words = 1(3)   Read the next word(4)   Add 1 to the number of words(5)   Repeat step (3) and (4) till the end of the paragraph(6)   After reading the paragraph, indicate the number of words
Activity
1. Write down as steps, two scenario that comprise repetition.2. Fill in the blanks below related to repetition that output 5 
times from 5 to 60.
I. n = 5
II. Output the value of n.III. Add 5 to the value of n.I V. Repeat step number ……… and ……….. till the value 
of n = 60.
1.3 Representation of an algorithm
Flow charts and pseudo codes are used as tools to present an algorithm to 
make the algorithm understand better.
10
 For free distribution1.3.1 Flowcharts
Flowcharts are used to present how the algorithm is built step by step in a 
dramatic manner. The symbols given in table are used to indicate different functions. 
(See Table 1.1)

Sequence
 In sequence the steps from the beginning to the end are executed in order.E.g. 1 - Finding the area of a circle.
Input the radius of the circle
Calculate the area of the circleStart
EndOutput the area of the circle

For free distribution 11Selection
The selection indicates the flow of direction depending on a condition being 
satisfied or not.
E.g. - Finding whether a number is odd or even
Input the number
Find the remainder when the 
number is divided by 2
Is the remainder 0?No An odd num ber          
Yes
An even number                   Start
End
Repetition
A step or several steps are repeated till a condition is satisfied or are 
continued till it is satisfied.E.g. - Finding the total of some numbers
Get the number NTotal = 0
Total = Total + N
Are there any more 
numbers?
Output the Total                                                                                      NoYesStart

 For free distributionActivity  
Draw flow charts to solve the problems given below.
1. Find the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
2.It is decided to add Rs.5000 to the basic salary of the employees of 
a company. Calculate the new salary.
3.When posting a letter, postal fare is charged according to its weight. The standard fare should be paid for letters which are equal to or less than the standard weight. An additional fare should be charged if the weight is more than the standard weight. 
4. Indicate the first 12 multiples of 7.  
5.   Draw flow charts for the examples in selection 1:2:1.
1.3.2 Pseudo codes
When an algorithm is presented in simple English terms it is called a pseudo 
code. Pseudo codes are independent of a computer language. Pseudo codes can be 
converted to any programming language instructions. Hence, pseudo codes make computer programming easier.
Let us see simple English terms used in an pseudo code.
BEGIN - To indicate a beginning
END  - To indicate an endINPUT , READ , GET - To indicate an inputOUTPUT, DISPLAY , SHOW  - To show an outputPROCESS, CALCULATE - To indicate a processIF … THEN .. .ELSE  … ENDIF  - Used to indicate a selectionFOR – DOWHILE – ENDWHILE 
}  Used to indicate a repetition
REPEAT - UNTIL
Writing pseudo codes
E.g. 1 - Finding the area of a circle
 BEGIN
  INPUT Radius 
  CALCULATE Area = 22/7 « Radius « Radius  DISPLAY Area
 END.
For free distribution 13E.g. 2 - Finding whether a number is odd or even
   BEGIN
  READ number as N
  CALCULATE  Remainder after number is divided by 2
  IF Remainder = 0 THEN   DISPLAY “Even number”
     ELSE
   DISPLAY “Odd number”  ENDIF
     END.
E.g. 3 - Finding the total of some numbers
BEGIN
  Total = 0
  REPEAT   READ Number as N   CALCULATE Total = Total + N  UNTIL numbers are over  DISPLAY Total
END.
E.g. 4 - Finding the total and the average of 10 numbers 
BEGIN
  Total = 0  Average = 0  n = 1  WHILE n <= 10
   READ Number 
   CALCULATE Total = Total + Number   n = n + 1  ENDWHILE  CALCULATE Average = Total/(n - 1)    DISPLAY Total, Average
END.
14
 For free distributionFollowing are some of the facts about the above pseudo code.
 ²Total, Average and Number are variables.
° When values are assigned to number variable, the value of Total, Average 
and n variables change.
 ²n indicates the number of repetitions. (Number of times the loop is executed)
 ²The statements Total = 0 and Average = 0, makes starting values of these 
variables assigned as 0.
° Hence, the initial value of Total and Average are 0s.
 ²The statement n = 1, makes the starting value of n is assigned to 1.
 ²n <= 10 is the condition that should be satisfied.
 ²WHILE n <= 10 indicates that the loop n should be repeated until value of n is 10.
° Repetition occurs when the value of n is 10 or less than 10. This means, 
till the condition n <=10 is true, repetition occurs. When the value of n becomes 11, the repetition stops. Then the condition becomes false. 
 ²READ denotes getting a value for Number variable.
 ²Total = Total + Number denotes the present value of Total is added to number and the resultant value is assigned on the new value of Total.
 ²n = n + 1 calculates the number of repetitions. 1 is added to the present value of n and the result is assigned to n.
 ²ENDWHILE indicates the limit to end repetition. Hence, only READ number, Total = Total + Number and n = n + 1 are repeated till the condition n <= 10 is fulfilled.
 ²When the repetition stops, the value of n is 11 and the condition is false. 
 ²By Average = Total/(n - 1) , final value of Total is divided by (n – 1) and that value is assigned to Average variable. 
 ²DISPLAY (Total, Average) produces the output of the total of 10 numbers and its average.  Total n
1+1=2number
number
number TotalTotal
2+1=30+12=12
12+15=27n
n
For free distribution 15 Observation
 ²When a value is assigned to a variable, the previous value is 
lost. 
 ²When the statement Total = Total + Number is executed, the value assigned to the Number variable is added with the value assigned to Total variable and the result obtained is assigned to the Total variable. 
 ²Total = Total + Number is not a mathematical formula.
1.3.3  Converting flow charts to pseudo codes
An algorithm can be presented in a flow chart as well as in a pseudo code. 
Hence, let us examine how a flow chart can be converted to a pseudo code.

1.4  Pascal programming
1.4.1 Identifiers 
An identifier is a term used to represent a variable, constant or a program. 
The following are some rules that should be followed in declaring an identifier.
Var year : integer ; 
data type
integer
reserved word
 variable identifier
 ²Reserved words in Pascal cannot 
be used as an identifier name. In any programming language reserved words cannot be used as identifiers.
E.g. - BEGIN, END are not valid(E.g. - A-Z, a-z)
 ²Should start with an English letter.
 ²After the first letter of the identifier, letters (a-z, A-Z) or numbers (0-9) and underscore ( _ ) can be used.
E.g. - Student_name
 ²Not case sensitive ( E.g. - Art, art, ART will be the same identifier)
 ²There should not be any space between words.
E.g. - Student Name - Not valid

 For free distribution ²The special characters such as the following should not be included in an 
identifier.
            ~    !   @   #   $  %   ^    &   *   (  )    -   +  =  {  }  [  ]  :  ;  ‘  “  <> ?  ,  .  /  |  \
but, only underscore ( _ ) is valid. 
 ²Use of meaningful terms for identifiers can make program easily understood.
Examples of valid identifiers
Sum, SUM, Total_Nos, Num1, FirstName, Last_Name
Examples of identifiers that are not valid
$75, Average Marks, 9A, Last-name
1.4.2 Reserved words
The reserved words in Pascal, are defined in Pascal language. Hence, 
reserved words are not used as identifiers.
Reserved words are different from language to language. The following are 
reserved words used in Pascal.

For free distribution 191.4.3 Standard data types in Pascal
When a program is executed, the input and output should be stored in 
computer memory. The space needed for each is defined according to the data type. 
Hence, it is essential for a programmer to have knowledge of data types. 
The following are data types and their ranges.
Integer - Plus or minus whole numbers 
 E.g. - 0, 46, -12
Real - Plus or minus decimal numbers 
E.g. - 0.0, 25.68
Boolean
 True or False
Char - Any character of the key  
 board 
 E.g.  - ‘k’, ‘#’, ‘7‘ 
String - Any sequence of characters
 E.g. - ‘ICT’, ‘programming’, ‘Sri Lanka’
Important
Values of Char and String are included inside single quotation ‘ ’.
1.4.4 Variables and constants
Variable
A variable is an identifier which changes the values given to it when the 
program is being executed. 
20
 For free distributionIn Pascal, “var” is used to declare variables. 
Retrive Store
E.g. - var  count : integer;
var  a,b : real;var  n1, n2 : integer;
  Avg : real ;  Pass : boolean;  Character : char;  Name,school : String;
Important
A variable has a name, and it stores a value of the declared type.
Constants
The identifiers which do not change their values while the program is 
executed are called constants. In Pascal, “const” is used to declare a constant.
Example
Const   max = 100;
Const   pi = 22/7;
Observation
 ²When executing a program, a variable can take different 
values. However, the value of a constant remains unchanged.
1.4.5 Operators
Operators are required to perform calculations, comparisons, and to evaluate 
logical expressions. Hence, operators are essential in programming.
For free distribution 21Basic types of operators 
  1. Algebra operators  
       Operator                Usage                       Example expression          Result
            +      Addition   6 + 3  9
-  Subtraction    7 - 5  2
*   Multiplication   2 * 5  10
/  Division   10/4            2.50
DIV  Division of round numbers  20 DIV 6 3
MOD   Remainder after division     20 MOD 6 2

2DIV
MOD
2. Comparison operator
Comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions. The final 
result of an expression which consists of a comparison always takes a Boolean value. Hence expression will be True or False.
      Function                Usage                    Example expression           Result
>  Greater than       7 > 3       True 
>=  Greater than or equal      8 >= 8       True
<  Less than      3 < 2      False  
<=  Less than or equal       4 <= 6          True
=  Equal          3 = 1      False
< >  Not equal      2 < > 5       True
3. 
Logical operators
Logical operators are used to combine two or more expressions. For further 
study on this refer. basic logic gates that you learnt in Grade 10.
22
 For free distributioni)  AND operator
AND operator takes the form “(First Expression) AND (Second 
Expression)”. Depending on the first expression or second expression being True 
or False, the result becomes True or False. The following table shows the function of AND.
First Expression Second Expression (First Expression) AND (Second 
Expression)
False False False
False True False
True False False
True True True
Example 
1. (Rain fall > 56) AND (Temperature < 30) 2. (Height > 60) AND  (Age < 15)3. Let us consider, (3 >= 2) AND(3 < > 3)        3 >= 2 is True. 3 < > 3 is False. Hence, the result of the expression is False.
Important
 If at least one operator out of the two operators is false, the AND evaluates to false.
 When only both operators are true, the expression of AND evaluates to true. 
ii)  OR operator
OR operator takes the form “(First Expression) OR (Second Expression)”. 
Depending on the first expression and second expression being True or False, the result of OR is True or False. The following table shows the function of the OR operator. 
First expression Second expression (First expression) OR (Second 
expression)
False False False
False True True
True False True
True True True
For free distribution 23Example
1.  (Temperature > 30) OR (Rainfall < 55) 
2.  Let us consider, (3 >= 2)  OR (3 < > 3) 
          3 >= 2 is True. 3 < > 3 is false. Hence, the result of the expression is true.
Important
 When at least one operator out of the two operators is true, the OR operator evaluates to true.
 When only both operators are false, the expression of OR operator evaluates to false.
iii)  NOT operator
A True expression is always evaluated as false with a NOT operator while a 
false expression is always evaluated as true.
Expression NOT (Expression)
False True
True False
Example  
1. NOT (Temperature > 30) 2. NOT(5 = 5) is indicated as false statement.     Therefore 5 = 5 is a true expression. Hence, the statement NOT (5 = 5) is 
indicated as false 
Operator precedence
When Pascal expressions are evaluated, the order of precedence is given 
below.

 ²“program”, “input” and “output” are reserved words.
 ²“addNum” is an identifier. This is the name of the program. It is not essential to indicate input, output within brackets with the program name.
 ²read( ) and readln( ) functions words are used for input.
 ¾Data is input to num1 variable through Read(num1); 
 ¾Data is input from readln() from a new row.
For free distribution 25 ²write( ) and writeln( ) functions are used for output.
 ¾From the function Write(‘Welcome Pascal Programming’) outputs 
'Welcome Pascal Programming'.
 ¾The function writeln(‘Average is ‘ , avg); prints the value of the Avg variable in a new line.
When writing Pascal statements;
=num 1

2.3Total
5.7 + ²Semi-colon (;) is used at the end of an statement. Semi-colon indicates the end of an statement.
 ²What happens with the expression  
total :} num1 + num2 is that it adds the 
variables num1 and num2 and assign result to the variable 'total'
 ²“:}’’ is the assignment operator.

1.4.7 Repetition
Let us examine how repetition structures are used when the number of 
repetitions is known in advance.
i) FOR – DO structure (1st Method)
FOR  Variable :} Value_1 TO Value_2 DO
 ²The data type of Variable , Value_1 and Value_2 should be integer.
 ²The value of Value_2 should be larger than Value_1 to start repetition.
 ²Repetition is started with Value_1  and ended with Value_2.
 ²Hence, FOR – DO structure can be used when the number of repetitions is 
known in advance.  
Repetition structure Starting 
valueEnding 
valueNumber of repetitions
FOR X :}1 TO 5 DO 1 5 5
FOR X :} 0 TO 4 DO 0 4 5
FOR X :} 5 TO 10 DO 5 10 6
30
 For free distributionE.g. - Printing the values from 1 to 10
Program print10Nos(input,output);
Var  count : integer;Begin
For  count :} 1 to 10 doWriteln(count);
End.
Here the count variable value is changed from 1 to 10 while printing the 
output values, and two loop is executed 10 times.
ii) FOR – DO  Loop (Method 2)
FOR  Variable :} Value_1 DOWNTO Value_2 DO
 ²The value of Value_1 should be smaller than Value_2 to start repetition.
 ²Repetition is started with Value_1 and ended with Value_2.
Repetition structure Starting value Ending value Number of 
repetitions
FOR X :} 10 DOWNTO 5 
DO10 5 6
FOR X :} 4 DOWNTO 0 DO 4 0 5
E.g. - Printing of values from 10 to 1
Program print Reverse (input,output);
Var  count : integer;Begin
For  count :} 10  downto 1 doWriteln(count);
End.
Count variable value is changed from 10 to 1 while printing the output and 
and the loop in executed 10 times.
For free distribution 31Finding the total and average of ten numbers
A block of statments in 
repetition.program total_avg (input,output);
var  I,num,total : integer; avg: real;Begin total :} 0; for I :} 1 to  10 do begin   writeln(‘Enter Number’);   read(num);   total :} total+num; end;   avg :} total/I;   writeln(‘Total is ‘ , total);   writeln(‘Average is ‘,avg); end.
}
Important
A block of statements indent properly is written between 'begin' and 'end'; inside the FOR loop.
When the number of repetitions are not known in advance, ''While do'' or 
''repeat until'' structures are used.
i) WHILE DO Loop
 ²Conditions are checked at the beginning of the loop.
 ²Statements inside the loop are executed (ie: a loop that runs for ever) only if the condition is true.
 ²Statements inside the loop never executed if the condition is false.
 ²The condition becomes false at the end of the repetition.
 ²If the condition does not become false while the repetition is executed, it will be an infinite loop.
E.g. 1 -  while number > 0 do 
  Repetition is executed if only the value of the variable number is positive.  
E.g. 2 - number :} 1;
    while number <= 10 do
  number :} number + 1;
32
 For free distribution◦ Condition is true since the starting value of the variable 'number' is 1.
◦ Hence, the repetition is executed.◦ Each time loop is executed, 1 is added to the value of ''number''.◦ Hence, Loop is executed when the value of ''number'' is 10 or less than 10.
◦ Loop stops when the value of the ''number'' variable is 11.
ii) REPEAT UNTIL Structure
 ²Condition is not checked at the beginning of loop.
 ²Condition is checked, after the statements are executed once.
 ²Loop is started if the condition is false only.
 ²Loop stops when the condition becomes true.
 ²If the condition does not become true while the loop is executed, loop will be an infinite loop.
E.g. 1 -
count = 0;Repeat
  writeln  ^‘Pascal’&;  count :} count + 1
Until count > 5;
◦ The starting value of count variable is 0.◦ The word Pascal is displayed on the screen.◦ 1 is added to the count variable.◦ It is checked whether the value of 'count' variable is larger than 5.◦ Loop is executed till the value of the 'count' variable becomes 5.◦ Loop stops when the value of count is 6.◦ When the Loop stops, the word Pascal is displayed six times on the screen.
E.g. 2 -
sum :} 0;repeat
  sum :} sum + 5;  writeln(sum);
until sum < 50;
For free distribution 33 ²The starting value of sum variable is 0.
 ²5 is added to the value of sum.
 ²The value of sum is 5 and it is displayed on the screen.
 ²It is checked whether the value of sum variable is less than 50.
 ²The condition sum < 50 is satisfied (True).
 ²Hence, Loop stops.
E.g. 3 -
sum :} 0;
repeat
  sum :} sum + 5;  writeln^sum&;
until sum >=  50;
 ²The starting value of sum variable is 0.
 ²5 is added to the value of sum.
 ²The value of sum is displayed on the screen.
 ²It is checked whether the value of sum variable is greater than or equal to 50.
 ²Loop is executed till sum >= 50 condition is satisfied (True).
 ²When the loop stops, the value of sum is 50.
 ²Loop is executed 10 times.
 ²Multiples of 5 from 5 to 50 will be given as output.
1.4.8  Nested control structures
Inside an algorithm, a control structure(s) may be included inside another. 
For example, a repetition loop may be included inside another repetition. Similarly a selection may be included inside another selection. Hence nested controlling structures should be used in programming.
1.4.8.1 Repetition inside selection
A repetition may be executed depending on a condition of a selection being 
satisfied or not.
E.g. - Depending on the user’s selection, an ascending or descending number 
            sequence can be produced as output.
34
 For free distributionprogram orderNos(input,output);
var  num:integer; cho:char;begin     writeln('Select Assending(A) or Desending(D)');     read(cho);     if cho = 'A' then        begin             writeln('Asending Order');             for num :} 1 to 6 do                 writeln(num);        end;     if cho = 'D' then         begin              writeln('Desending Order');              for num :} 6 downto 1 do                  writeln(num);         end;end.
1.4.8.2 Selection in repetition
 Let us consider how selection takes place while the repetition control structure 
being executed.
E.g. - Determining whether the numbers input by the user are odd or even and
           calculating the total number of odd, even numbers separately. 
program rep_sel(input,output);
var num,rem,count,e_count,o_count:integer;begin     for count :} 1 to 10 do         begin              writeln('Enter Number');              read(num);              rem :} num mod 2;              if rem = 0 then                 begin                      writeln('Even number ');                      e_count :} e_count+1;
For free distribution 35                 end
              else                  begin                       writeln('Odd number ');                       o_count :} o_count + 1;                  end;         end;     writeln(e_count,'Even Number/s');     writeln((o_count ,'Odd Number/s');end.
1.9.1 Arrays
It is essential in programming to use variables to store data items in 
memory. Further, such variables have suitable data types. Various variables which are different in names are needed to store data items which belong to the same data type.
E.g. - For instance, five variables are needed to save five round numbers in the 
           memory. Before using such variables, they should be declared as given below.
Var p, q, r, s, t : integer;   
n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 : real;
1.4.9.1 Use of arrays
An array is used to save data items of the same type in memory using a 
single variable identifier name. Hence, use of array enables to store data as required 
under a single variable identifier name without providing different variable names to each item.
  
Each cart holds a 
single piece of dataHere comes the data 
train
36
 For free distribution1.4.9.2 Defining a one-dimensional array
This is a data structure used to save data of the same type sequentially. An 
array uses a group of adjoining memory spaces. A one dimensional array can be as 
follows.
Var  Name_of_Array ( array [first index .. last index ] of data type
E.g. - var marks ( array [0''9] of integer;
 ²From this, the array named marks is defined which can include 10 whole numbers.
1.4.9.3 Attributes of an array
 ²Elements of an array are positioned next to each other. (re adjacently)
 ²The index of an array (sequential number) is indicated with the array name in square brackets.
M[0]
X[0]M[1]
X[1]M[2]
X[2]M[3]
X[3]M[4]
X[4]First element
lowest indexLast element 
highest indexArray Name 
Index
element 1
 element 5

For free distribution 37E.g. - the size of the array Var M : Array[0..4] of integer;  is 5.
From M[0] to M[4], it consists of 5 elements.  Index is indicated in square brackets.Depending on the way array is defined, index positions get changed.
E.g. - ; Var X : Array[1..5] of integer;
Only data items which belong to the same type can be stored in the array.
Any element of the array can be accessed randomly. Hence, an array can be 
accessed easily through a repetition control structure.  
E.g. - Entering Maths marks of 40 students into an arrayvar  maths : array[0..39] of integer;
i,marks : integer; 
for i :} 0 to 39 do
begin
  writeln(‘Enter marks’);
  read(marks);  maths[i] :} marks;
end;
1.4.9.4 Assigning values to an array
Let us consider integer array with 5 five elements which can input whole numbers. 
num[0] num[1] num[2] num[3] num[4]
45 36 60
45 75 36 81 60var   num : array[0..4] of integer;
num[0] :} 45; 
num[2] :} 36,num[4] :} 60;num[1] :} num[4] + 15;
num[3] :} num[0] + num[2]

 For free distribution1.4.9.5 Declaring values of an array
The elements declare the values of an array. 
writeln ^num[3]&;     Print the 4th element (81)
writeln ^num[1]" num[4]&;   Declaring  2nd and 5th elements (36, 60)
for  x :} 0 to 3 do     Print the first 4 elements of the array (45, 75,
                  36, 81) 
writeln ^num[x]&; for  x :} 2 to 4 do   
    Print the 3 elements - 3rd, 4th, 5th - of the array
        (36, 81, 60) writeln ^num[x]&; for  x :} 0 to 4 do   
  Print all the elements of the array (45, 75, 36,
       81, 60) 
E.g. - Entering Information and Communication Technology marks of 35 students,
          determining the highest mark and calculating the average.

As a program becomes complex, when the number of sub processes increase, 
it will be difficult to read and understand and also to maintain. Therefore, using sub programs as much as possible while writing useful.

Hello Mr. 
Computer?

A program is a sequence of instructions 
which is designed to perform a certain task is using the computer. A computer language is needed to provide the instructions.  

For free distribution 431.5.2  Low level programming languages
Machine language
This is a language which can be directly understood by the computer. 
Binary numbers such as 0s and 1s (bits) are used to provide instructions. Hence, the 
processor could directly run a program written in a machine language.
A program written in machine language has the following features;
 ²Could be executed directly on the machine
 ²Fast in operation
 ²No need of language translating programs to translate the program into binary
 ²Dependency on machines (a program written to one computer may not run 
on another computer)
 ²Difficult to understand by humans as it is written using 0 and 1.
Assembly language
Instead of commands written in a machine language using 0 and 1,  assembly 
language is designed to use simple symbols.
A program written in assembly language has the following features:
 ²Operation is comparatively slower than the machine language.
 ²Assembly language should be translated to instructions using the language 
translating program called assembler.
 ²Dependency on machines (a program written for one computer cannot be run on another computer.)
 ²The use of symbols makes it more simple to understand.

1.5.4  Programming language types 
Programming is a creative task where a computer programmer provides 
instructions to the computer on how to perform a particular task. A program can be defined as a set of instructions which instructs the computer which task should be carried out to find a solution to a certain problem.
There are many different approaches to computer programming. These are 
called programming paradigms. Different approaches develop solutions to problems using programs using different paradigms. Even though most of the programming languages come under one paradigm type, certain languages show elements related to different paradigms.

Difference between procedural and declarative paradigms
A procedural language is a computer programming language which consists 
of a well structured set of steps and procedures. This includes statements for problem 
solving steps.

 For free distributionThe Pascal programming has procedural paradigm features.
A declarative paradigm develops a structure and elements of computer 
program by indicating calculations and/or logic without a control flow. This helps to 
reduce or eliminate side effects. In declarative programming, program is designed to solve problems explaining what you want rather than stating how to solve the problem as in primary programming languages. The program itself does not explain how it is executed. This means the computer is provided only what the problem and the required solutions are, not how to solve it. The computer finds solutions related to the given problem. This is completely different from procedural paradigms which execute algorithm as explanatory steps. Declarative paradigms related to Artificial Intelligence.

Comparison of structured and object oriented paradigms
A structured program is a logic based paradigm and it is the pre discussed 
object oriented program. A structured programming paradigm provides facilities to understand and modify the program. The system is divided into sub systems and there is a top – down flow in it.

 Object  
Property  Method  Object oriented programming is a 
programming paradigm based on the concept 
of objects. Objects consists of data and 
methods. Methods are codes that are in the form of procedures that handle data.  These 
data structures exist in the form of fields which are called Attributes. Class is the basic structure of object oriented programming. Class describes the behaviours of data and instances. Class can create objects of same type.
An object-oriented program consists of many objects interacting

1.5.4  Language translators
Programs written in any computer language except in machine language 
(object code) should be translated to machine language instructions before execution. 
A program written in assembly language is translated to machine language 
instructions using a language translator called assembler.
Two types of language translators can be used to translate a program written in a 
high-level language to machine language instructions. They are:
1. Interpreter2. Compiler
50
 For free distributionInterpreter
This is the language translator which translates each statement written in a 
high-level computer language to machine language commands one by one and the 
translated program is executed using the necessary commands instantly.
When translating object codes in computer languages which use interpreters,  
1. If there are no syntax errors in the program, the statement will be executed
2.If there are syntax errors in the program, it will not execute to the end. (it is possible to operate it till the error is reached)
Important
An interpreter translates code each time the program is executed.

When translating source code to machine code in computer languages which 
use compilers:
1.If there are no syntax errors in the program, code is translated to machine code.
2.If there are syntax errors in the program, it is not be translated to machine code. 
These errors are highlighted.
Important
After the program is translated to machine code once, it can be execute any number of times. A translation is needed again only if the source code is changed.

 ²Input, output and the process can be identified by analyzing a problem.
 ²Flowcharts and pseudo codes can be used to develop an algorithm.
 ²Sequence, selection and repetition are three control structures used in an 
algorithm.
 ²Sequence performs steps in an algorithm one after the other from the beginning to the end.
 ²Selection is a situation where the step executed should be decided based on a condition being fulfilled or not.
 ²If a step or some steps in an algorithm are repeated until a condition is satisfied or to maintain the condition being satisfied, it is called repetition.
 ²A name used to identify a variable, constant or a program is called an identifier.
 ²If the values assigned for identifiers are changed when the program is being executed, these are called variables.
 ²Pascal is a high level programming language.Summary

 For free distribution ²Evaluation of an expression occurs depending on the priority level of 
functions.
 ²Machine language and Assembly language are considered low–level programming languages.
 ²Languages like PASCAL, BASIC, C and JA V A are examples of high–level programming languages.
 ²A program written using Machine language can be directly run in the processor.
 ²A program written in any computer language except in Machine language should be translated to Machine language instructions before it runs.

2.2 System Development Processes
To develop an information system, there are different methodologies. The 
System	Development	Life	Cycle	is	one	aspect	of	the	process.
For free distribution 56 For free distribution 572.2.1 System Development Life Cycle  
This has the following steps.
1.Identification of requirements
2. Designing the solution
3. Coding  of the solution4. Testing and debugging5.Deployment of  the system
6.Maintenance of the system
This process can be iterated to go back to the first step when new requirements 
arise.
Phases of System Development Life Cycle 
 1. Identification of requirements
A complete investigation on the existing manual system or the computer 
based system to be delivered is carried out in this phase. Aspects such as objectives, benefits, efficiency etc are constructed. This is carried out in collaboration with the  staff of the organization and the development team. 
At this stage the system analyst will study the existing system extensively 
and identify new requirements. The developer also collects information to fulfill the needs of the user. There are several methods of gathering information. Some of them are as follows;
1.Observation
2.Interviews
3. Questionnaires4.Document sample collection
5. Prototyping
1.  Observation
At the initial stages of developing a computer based system, the existing 
system is observed as it is, to gather information. This is important towards making assumptions.
E.g. - Observation of issuing of books in a library2.   Interviews
Since the interview provides an opportunity to discuss matters related to 
personal attitudes openly, it is useful to identify personal requirements. E.g. - Meeting the librarian for a discussion.
For free distribution 58
 For free distribution 593.   Questionnaires
A  questionnaire is used in user requirement gathering. Answers collected 
are	analyzed	for	understanding	the	needs.		
E.g. -Handing	over	a	questionnaire	to	the	librarian	for	his/her	responses
4.   Document sample collection	 Reports	or	files	maintained	in	an	organization	under	study	are	examined	for	
information.
E.g. - Reports, library cards available in a library
5.   Prototyping
A model or a prototype of the proposed system to be implemented is 
developed and demonstrated to the staff and the users for feedback and comments.  
E.g. - A display of screenshots, records, samples
 2. Designing the solution
     At this stage, actual design of the proposed system takes 
place. Some activities related to the design process are as 
follows:
1.	 Identification	of	software	and	software	architecture
2.	 User	interface	-	what	the	user	sees	on	the	screen	and	preparation	for	data	
storage
3.Identification	of	main	hardware	systems	and	its	components
4.Identification	of	dependency	of	each	sub-system
5. Deciding on the required hardware and software to run the system6. Designing infrastructure for software, databases, user interfaces7. Planning of tests
 3. Coding  of the solution
        The main objective of this stage is coding 
of the proposed system, using a suitable computer language.	 Making	 the	 code	 simple	 and	 efficient	enables one to develop and understand easily. A well-written	 code	 makes	 it	 easy	 to	 read	 and	understand and reduces maintenance cost.  
For free distribution 58 For free distribution 59
 4. Testing and debugging
 The main objective of this phase is to resolve 
errors. Errors in cording, planning and requirements  are corrected.  There are several methods to test a system.  
Some of them are as follows:
  Unit testing
Integration testing 
System testing
Acceptance testing
					Figure	2.5	-	System	Testing
1) Unit T esting
      Each unit in the system is tested. Outputs are tested against 
the given output.
E.g. - Testing the units related to the Accounts branch and 
         Establishment branch independently.
2) Integration Testing
    Units already tested and debugged are integrated to form 
the complete system and the integrated system is tested at this stage.
3) System Testing
    The complete system is tested for its outputs for the given 
inputs. 
For free distribution 60
 For free distribution 614) Acceptance Testing
       Acceptance or user acceptance testing is carried out at the 
late stages of testing. This testing is carried out at with the users 
of the system and the user is allowed to use the system. Either the user approves or request for more improvements.
  5. Deployment of the system
   Deployment (ie install and use) of the system which has 
been tested and debugged is carried out at this stage.    There are different deployment approaches to deploy a 
system. They are as follows:
1.	Direct deployment
2.	Parallel deployment
3. Pilot deployment4. Phased deployment
Direct deployment
    The existing system is totally terminated and the new 
system is installed. If the new system proves successful, the old system can be abandoned.
E.g. -   The manual system in the library can be totally abandoned 
    using and new library management software can be 
           installed.
Parallel deployment
 The existing and the new systems are used 
parallel for a certain period. If the new system proves successful, the old system can be terminated and the new system continues.
E.g. - Using the newly deployed system in the library
          together with the existing manual system.
Pilot deployment
 Pilot deployment is about using the newly 
developed system in a selected area. 
E.g. - A	system	for	the	whole	country	can	first	be	
 installed in a selected district. 
For free distribution 60 For free distribution 61E.g. - A	system	for	revenue	collection	from	vehicles	can	first	be	installed	in	one	
           province of the country and if, successful, can be deployed in all provinces               of the country.  
Phased deployment
 Here, the new system is deployed in stages. 
Success with each stage leads to the next and in 
completing the new system, the old system is completely replaced by the new.   
E.g. -	Types	of	books	in	school	library,	i.e.	Dictionaries	first,	course	books	second											and	fictionlast,	to	be	deployed	in	stages.	
 6. Maintenance of the system
 A system once installed and in the use for a 
certain period, needs to be maintained well. The computers, software and computer networks are all maintained in this manner. With system maintenance, the following may 
be required.
 ²Developing systems to suit new user requirements
 ²Issues	that	surfaced	with	the	use	of	the	system	which	were	not	identified	during	system development. 
 ²Adopting	new,	technology	into	the	new	system	to	improve	efficiency
2.2.2 System Development Life cycle Models  
	 There	are	several	models	of	Systems	Development	Life	Cycle.	Each	model	facilitates the system development in different ways. Some example models are:
1.	Waterfall  Model
2.	Iterative Incremental Model
3. Prototyping Model4. Spiral Model 
Waterfall Model
 The Waterfall Model consists of several stages of linear development. To 
develop a system using the  Waterfall Model, the following need consideration.

 In this model, a system is developed through repeated cycles (Iterative) 
and in smaller portions at a time (incremental). The process starts with a simple implementation	of	a	sub-set	of	the	software	requirements	and	iteratively	enhances	the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented. At each iteration, design	modifications	are	made	and	now	functional	capabilities	are	added.	This	modal allows software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development and use of the system.

The Internet is a collection of comput er 
networks around the world. It is the fastest 
available way to share information with the world community (Information super highway). With the use of Internet today, the whole world has become a global village. The Internet, which renders such a big service, does not possess a single owner and a non profitable organization called "The Internet Society" is in charge of the ethics and principles related to the use of the Internet and the protocols which maintain Internet operations. When you access the Internet from your computer, it also becomes a computer which belongs to the Internet. Then it is possible for you to obtain any information related to any subject you need.3 The Internet and the electronic mail

Information which helps us to improve our knowledge is a very important 
resource. Among the avenues of obtaining information, the Internet is the most 
powerful. To transmit this information among the computers in the Internet, the protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used. Further, the Internet contains a huge amount of information. The main service which provides this information is the World Wide Web (www). Therefore, the information in the World Wide Web is included in web sites. Thus, the system used to uniquely identify various resources in web sites is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
Let us identify parts of a URL
For example, let us consider the URL given below.
http://www.edupub.gov.lk/e-books/english/ict.pdfWe can separate the parts here as given below.

 For free distribution 673.1.3 what is an IP address?
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are used to individually identify all the 
computers in the Internet. The IP address is indicated in four values from 0 to 255 
separated by a decimal point. This is called Dotted Decimal Notation.
Example   172.64.85.42
  193.213.78.154
  Figure 3.2 - Using IP addresses to identify computer in the Internet
These IP addresses are assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An 
Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company and it provides access to Internet. For 
this, the ISP charges a fee for the service.
3.1.4  what is a domain name?
Let us consider the domain name  
edupub.gov.lk of the Uniform Resource Locator given above. Here gov represents the government and lk represents Sri Lanka. Thus, lk domain which comes after gov domain is the top level domain name. Domain name gives an identity to all the websites which exist in the Internet. 
Following are the names used to represent the fields which the domains 
belong to.

3.1.5 How the Internet works 
Humans, being different from computers, have difficulty in retaining lots 
of similar numbers in mind. Working with names is much easier for them and 
cause less errors. That is why we rarely see the numbers as URLs on the Internet. When a URL is entered to the browser to view a website, the request must first be translated from the readable written address into an IP address that can be routed. This translation is done by the Domain Name System (DNS).
If a request is made to connect to certain website, for example www.yahoo.
com, the request is first sent to the DNS server to translate into the correct IP address of 209.191.122.70. The actual connection to the website is done with this IP address. This process happens behind the screen quickly that the user does not notice.

For free distribution 68 For free distribution 69  The Internet is a Wide Area Network (WAN) which is based on a Client 
Server Model. Hence, all the computers in Internet belong either to the type of 
servers or clients.
Figure 3.4 - Client server architecture in the Internet
The computer that distributes the resources required by the client computer 
is called the "server". 
The activity of retrieving information from the server computers to 
client computers is called "downloading".
The activity of providing information from client computers to 
server computers is called "uploading".
Hence, transfer of information between server and client computers is 
two-way.
Let us identify some Internet server computers.
Web Server - Storing web pages and providing these to the client computers
Mail Server - Storing electronic mail and providing them to the client computersDNS Server - translating URL to IP addresses

World Wide Web is a service provided by 
the Internet and it is a large collection of electronic 
documents saved in computers all around the 
world connected to the Internet.
Sir Tim Berners Lee is considered the 
father of www. A user who uses www can access web sites through a Web Browser. 
A Web Browser is an application software. 
Following are some examples of Web Browsers.
Figure 3.5 - Web Browsers
A we b site consists of several web pages. 
There can be written text, images, videos and other multimedia and hyperlinks included in a web page. Use of hyperlinks makes browsing the web sites easy. To access a web site, Uniform Resource Locator – URL (web site address) should be typed on the address bar of the web browser and the ‘Enter’ key pressed. The page which contains the basic information about the web site is called the ‘Home Page’. The other pages of the web site can be accessed through the hyperlinks included in it. 
For instance, let us consider the official web site of the Department of Examinations, 
Sri Lanka.

File of smaller size can be sent with an e mail 
as an attachment. But files with larger capacities cannot 
be sent in an e mail attachments.
FTP is used to transfer large files of one 
computer in the Internet to another computer. This 
protocol is operated on TCP/IP and used to upload files of a client computer to the Internet and to download files from server computers in the Internet.
Figure 3.7 - File transfer system
3.1.6.3 Remote Access
Figure 3.8 - Remote access  
   
 
   
Controlling and operating a computer in the Internet remotely is performed 
through remote access. Following are certain functions which can be performed 
through Remote Access after accessing the Internet.
1. Installing software of server computers to client computers.
2. Fixing problems on client computers.
For free distribution 72
 For free distribution 73Using remote access functionality sometimes hackers steal important data 
and information stored on computers without owner's knowledge (This is called 
hacking).
3.1.6.4 File Sharing
 
The main objective of computer networking is 
to share resources. Such resource sharing includes file sharing. Thus, sharing of various files in the Internet take place often.
Example
1. When you check exam results on line, that file is accessed by a large number of 
clients at the same time.
2. Thousands of users can be connected to a web site at the same time.
3.1.6.5 Streaming of Media
A user visits a Web page hosted on a Web server and finds a file he'd like to see or hear. 
The Web server sends a message to streaming media Server, requesting the specific file.
The streaming server streams the file to the user's computer, bypassing the Web server Basic Streaming Process

consists of multimedia such as text, images audio and video. Downloading images, 
songs and videos etc from the Internet can be considered as an example.
3.1.6.6 Search Engines
 Web sites largel y contain information on the 
Internet. These websites should obtain information. For this, you should know the address (URL) of the web site. However, the unlimited number of websites in the Internet makes it practically very difficult. 
 Search engines are designed for the Internet 
users to find any information easily.
 After typing the key words in the search box of the search engine and 
clicking the search button, you will get a large number of web sites with hyperlinks which contain the information you need. You can obtain the necessary information by clicking one or several hyperlinks. 
Given below are some examples of search engines used often.

This provides a virtual environment of servers to provide space to store data 
and software applications with the help of server computers and also to provide 
various resources through the use of large data centres established.
E.g. - Obtain the facilities of server space and firewall through cloud computing 
            even though you do not own them
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This platform provides necessary server environment for software 
development. This gives facilities including operating system, programming language environment, database and web server.
E.g. -  Software can be developed in the cloud computer service even though you do
           not have installed operating system or compilers in your computer.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
This provides software installed in cloud without installing the software 
required by the user.
This reduces the cost and complexity of buying and managing hardware and 
developing software needed for software by the user.
E.g. - In Android devices, word processing software, spreadsheet packages etc that 
           can be used not by installing them in the device but using a web browser.

4.1  Digital Graphics
 
 From times immemorial man practiced the art of drawing and colouring 
to portray a beautiful idea, or a visual that left a lasting impression. Ancient wall paintings remind us about the important role played by artistry in conveying ideas. Pictures formed the basis of communication. At the same time, available pictures make us realize the difficulties our ancestors would have faced to convert an idea into an illustration. There would have been many drawbacks in mixing of colours. Yet, they overcame such drawbacks to leave behind the paintings seen today.  However, with the development of technology and the availability of software 
for digital graphics, it is now possible to create various graphical illustrations and edit them. Using such software for graphics is quite simple and interesting. Drawings or images, created with the use of computer graphic software, are 
called digital graphics.4Use of Multimedia

Figure 4.1 - Basic elements of digital graphics
 ²Pixel
A pixel is a tiny illuminated dot having a colour which is displayed on a 
computer screen. The digital graphics are created with thousands of such pixels.  
These pixels get arranged in rows or columns close to each other to produce 
graphical image (fig. 4.2). A digital graphic is an array of rectangular pixels called 
a bitmap.
Pixel 
Pixel array
Pixel row
Pixel column Magnified image
Fig 4.2 - Pixel
The size of a graphic can be increased or decreased to fit into a computer 
screen or a printing paper. In changing the size of the original graphic, the size of the pixel is changed. When the graphic has a smaller number of pixels its quality decreases when  it is enlarged (fig 4.3). 
For free distribution 82 For free distribution 83
Fig 4.3 - Decrease in quality in an enlarged graphic
Colours used in a graphic are represented by the number of bits per pixel 
(bpp) used. Graphics which use more bits per pixel are higher quality.
 ²Colours in a pixel and the number of bits
The number of bits per pixel determines the colours used in an image.
A single bit represents two colours Two bits represent four colours
two colours0 }1four colours00  01  10
11    }
However, by observing a graphic, it is not possible to determine the numbers 
of colours per pixel used. The number of bits used for the pixel only help find out the number of colours per pixel used. The following function can be used for the purpose.
Colour per pixel used  = 
(2) bpp ^bits per pixel &
E.g. - If a pixel has 4 bits,
Colour used on the pixel  = ^2&4
    = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
    = 16 colours
To find the number of bits when the colours are known:The number bits per pixel  = √colour
    
    = √16
The number of bits per pixel  =  4

Fig 4.4 - Image Resolution Pixels are used to measure the physical 
dimension of a digital graphic. The physical 
dimension is displayed as the image resolution.    This illustration in Figure 4.4 is 250 pixels wide and 175 pixels high. The image resolution, therefore, is 250 x 75 pixels or 43,750 pixels. A high resolution digital graphic using a large 
number of pixels is higher in quality. To determine the quality of a graphic the number of pixels per 
inch (ppi) used (horizontal or vertical) or the number of dots per inch (dpi) used (horizontal or vertical) are considered. (Figure 4.5)
For free distribution 84 For free distribution 85
Fig. 4.5 - Number of dots per inch (dpi)
 ²Colour  
 A digital graphic contains tens of thousands of pixels. Each pixel represents 
a colour. Therefore, a pixel is a small dot with a colour.
 There are about 16 million of recognizable colours visible to the naked eye.  
This number comes from a mixture of colours. However, it is difficult to correctly recognize each colour. (figure 4.6)
Ultra Violet  Infrared Colours visible to the 
naked eye        
Fig 4.6 - Colours visible to the naked eye
 In designing digital graphics it is possible to use many colours. The colour 
model which should be used for the design must be decided based on the output device or the media. (figure 4.7)
Two widely used colour models are shown on figure 4.7
CMYK ModelColor Models
RGB Model
Fig 4.7 - Colour Models
 ²RGB Model – This is widely used to create images on television screens or 
computer screens using coloured lights. The Primary Colours used here are Red, Green and Blue.
 ²CMYK Model – This model is used for printing on paper using coloured inks. The Primary Colours used here are Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black.

Fig 4.8 - Mixing colours
Colours are very useful to maintain the quality of the picture or illustration. 
Single colours are known as primary colours. Colours made by mixing two colours 
are known as secondary colours while tertiary colours are made by mixing three colours. There are 256 (0 - 255) colour variations in a primary colour. 
Forming a tertiary colour
To make a tertiary colour, the colour combination should be from 000, 000, 
000 to 255, 255, 255. This is known as RGB Triplet and it can be represented in octal numbers as RGB (245, 102, 36) or RGB (F5, 66, 24). (Figure 4.9)

For free distribution 86 For free distribution 87Graphic size and compression
The size of a graphic is determined by the number of pixels, the number 
of lines and the colour combinations used for the creation. A graphic with a large 
number of pixels, colours and a high resolution has a large file size. There may be difficulties in storing and transmission of such a graphic. Graphic compression is used to compress file size. Compression can be carried out at the time of saving the graphic or later.
The file formats used for compression in saving a graphic may or may not 
cause affect to the original quality of the graphic. The file formats are created using different algorithms to suit the compression.
There are two methods for graphic compression - Lossy compression and 
Lossless compression. (Figure 4.10)

Fig 4.10 - Use of Compression methods
It is possible to compress graphics to a minimum size using Lossy file 
formats, but this compression reduce the quality of the original graphic. The reopened graphic does not show its original form. Yet, to make it faster for compression and for saving and downloading from the Internet, Lossy compression is useful. JPEG, TIFF, BMP are a example for Lossy file formats. 
On the other hand, it is possible to compress a graphic preserving its 
original quality. In opening such a file, it is displayed in its original quality. This compression is identified as Lossless format. GIF, PNG, RAW are examples for Lossless file formats.

Digital graphics fall into two main categories. They are raster graphics and 
vector graphics. The type of graphic (raster or vector) is decided according to the 
graphical software used.  
There is a difference between Raster graphic and Vector graphic. Let us 
identify them.

There are many software types for the creation of static graphics. A few of 
them were mentioned earlier. Most of such software need to be purchased while 
some may not be compatible for all Operating Systems. Therefore, let us see a software that comes free and can be downloaded from the Internet.
GIMP
GIMP is an image manipulation program created for GNU free and 
open source operating system. This free software is widely used to reconstruct photographs, create graphics, edit and formatting of graphics. This software with many tools helps with the creation a simple graphic as well as to edit a high quality photographs. GIMP software belongs produces raster graphics.
GIMP software is UNIX based. It can also be installed on Microsoft 
Windows and Mac Operating system to install GIMP on a computer, go to http://www.gimp.org/downloads/.

 The use of Layers is important for both simple and complex 
graphic creations. It is easy to manipulate objects on a graphic by using 
different layers.  Layers resemble sheets of transparent paper. However, when 
objects are added one above the other, the layer beneath may not be shown.  
 ²For, different pictures, different layers are to be created on layer window.
 ²For each image a separate layer must be used on the layer window.
 ²This prevents alterations done on one layer affecting another layer. (adding texts, adding colour, shapes, editing etc).
 ²Use the eye symbol to make the layer visible or invisible.
 ²Use the bottom line of layer window to make various alterations.

4.2  Two - dimensional animation
The previous lesson discussed several areas connected with the creation of 
digital graphics as related to digital creations and graphic design.
The main aim of animation is to give more depth to a static graphic and 
make it look real or authentic.
For free distribution 102 For free distribution 103Creative animations are used in commercial publications, as a media to 
promote products, to develop computer games and creating cartoon films.
What is animation?
Animation is an optical illusion to show the movements of an object or 
objects. A series of frames of an object or objects are arranged in a sequential order 
and displayed continuously to create the animation. The speeds of the objects can be changed by changing the speed of frames.
Basics of animation
Types of Frames
Several frames are used to create an animation. They are: Key frame, Tween 
frame, frames, and Blank Key frames. 
 ²Key Frame:  A key frame is the main, specialised static frame in a series of 
frames to be used with the creation of an animation.  The user decides on the key frame for the creation. In a complete motion, there can be many key frames in important positions.  
E.g. - The frames used at the beginning and at the end of motion are Key Frames.
 ²Tween Frames: Animation is created in the Tween Frame. The purpose of a 
tween frame is to create smooth motion between two frames. While the user creates the key frames, the software creates the tween frame.  It is possible to create smooth motion of 24 frames per second (fps). In a motion consisting of 24 frames, the additional 22 frames are created as Tween frames.
E.g. - There are two key frames; one at the beginning and the other at the end. In a motion of 24 frames, the rest of the 22 frames are created by the computer programme. Eventually, The user creates an animation with a smooth motion with little effort. 
 ²Frames: When an adjoining frame is added to a frame with a content, the time 
period of the content in the animation can be increased.
 ²Blank Keyframe: In every instance when blank key frame is added, it provides 
a blank frame to include a content. However, when a creation is done in this, it is no longer a blank key frame.

Vectorian Giatto
Vectorian Giatto is produced for animations. It is a free software and can be 
downloaded from the Internet. This software is easy to use and requires no coding 
unlike with some other software for animation.    
The main purpose of this software is to embed motion for created images, 
while there are nearly 50 flash animation tools.
The specialty with Vectorian Giatto is in its ability to remain free from 
complex scripts and enable creation of simple animation including music.

 ²Content of a website
 ²Fundementals of Web designing
 ²Publishing a website
 ²Maintaining a website
5.1 Structuring information for web designing
 
 There are several aspects that attention should be paid when designing a 
web site. Imagine you are member of a group of students assigned to design a website. You should consider factors such as the purpose, the user, and how to maintain the website etc.
5.1.1 Web  applications
There are several web applications. Examples are as follows. 
i)    Information Communication
 There are websites designed to communicate various information such as 
educational and health for the users. 
Example - www.nie.lk, www.surgery.lk, www.webopedia.org
ii)   e Commerce
 This includes websites which sell goods and services through the Internet.
Example - www.farlin.lk, www.lego.lk, www.amazon.com
iii)  Entertainment
 There are websites for entertainment which provides download materials 
such as songs, films and teledramas, games, broadcasts and telecasts
Example - www.islandcricket.lk, www.netflix.com, www.youtube.com5Web Designing Using Multimedia
For free distribution 126
 For free distribution 127iv)   Advertising
These websites provides information on goods and services provided by 
various organizations. 
Example - www.onclickads.net, www.adcash.com, www.myadvertisingpays.com
v)    News
These websites publish news using multimedia.
Example - www.itnnews.lk, www.rupavahini.lk, www.bbc.co.ukvi)   Social Media
These websites provide facilities to develop social networking among 
various groups depending on their educational background, occupation, tastes or 
other factors.
Example - www.facebook.com, www.linkedin.com, www.twitter.com
vii)  Search engine
These websites provide facilities to find information from the World Wide 
Web using a word or a phrase as the key.
Example - www.google.com, www.msn.com, www.bing.com
viii) Personal
These are often used by popular persons such as writers and politicians to 
disseminate their information.
Example - www.president.gov.lk, www.arthurcclarke.net, www.nelsonmandela.org
5.1.2 Web user groups
Those who access a website and use are known as the users of the website. 
For instance, www.google.com is used by many people around the world and they 
are the users of the Google website.
In designing a website, it is understood that the user is important. The 
following are useful in understanding them:
1. Language and culture2. Age3. Educational level4. Gender5. Preferences
For free distribution 126 For free distribution 127When designing a new website, various methods can be used to understand 
the target user group.
For instance,
1. conducting a study on target users.
2. Analyzing similar websites.
For example, let us consider, the home page of the official Website of Sri 
Lanka (Figure 5.1) and website of Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. (Figure 5.2). You can observe that there are facilities to access them in all the three languages.
The website in Figure 5.2 provides the facilities to change the font size 
according to the user preference and to access social networks.

5.1.3 Web content
All the audio-visual information and services a user comes across in a 
website are called its web content. The web content of the new website should be 
selected considering the need/s of the user identified in the user group analysis. Web content should include the information to be communicated to the user as well as all the services to be provided to the user.
Various types of information and services can be found in the web content 
of websites. Following are some of them:
 ²Texts : information given in short  
 ²Images : photos taken from a camera, clip arts, drawings, scanned
 ²Sound : songs, voice clips  
 ²Video : video clips 
 ² Animations 
 ²Copyrights and information about updates
For free distribution 128 For free distribution 129 ²Hyperlinks to other documents, pictures, audio-visual files, and social 
networks  
 ²Advertisements
 ²Search facilities
 ²Facilities to download certain software required to use the website. 
As an example of identifying web content, examine the website of 
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (www.trc.gov.lk) given in Figure 5.2.  
5.1.4 Content Management
Systematic organization of the selected content of a website is known 
as content management. The main objective of this is to provide facilities to the users to use the website more effectively. Given below are some features of a well organized website.
 ²Easy to use 
 ²Can find the information user needs fast
 ²Attracts users
 ²Easy to update
 ²Has room to add new features later
If the amount of information selected for the web content of the website is 
small, organizing web content is easy. However, if it contains a large amount of various types of audio-visual information, various methods are used organizing web content of such websites. Following are some examples;
1.Classification based on site map
By developing a site map to classify the web content, one can get a clear 
picture about the web pages need to be created in the website and the hyperlinks 
(link among pages) need to be created among these. For instance, in the site map shown in Figure 5.3 - website of a school, the  number of web pages need to be created is indicated in square structures and the hyperlinks need to be created for interlinks among those pages are indicated in lines.

Figure 5.4 - Main menu and Sub Menu  
3.  Present information in brief
The attention of the user may not be drawn to some information, when 
a large amount of information is included in a single web page. Therefore, the 
content of a single web page should be limited.
4.  Use of numbered lists, bulleted lists and indentation
This prevents the user getting exhausted by reading long text paragraphs. 
5. Providing the facility for the user to navigate the website easily

 For free distribution 1336.  Updating
Web site should be easy to update by the person maintaining the site. The 
accuracy of information is assured when the copyrights and the updated time 
periods are included clearly in each page.
5.1.5 Structure and layout
Structure and layout are the features such as backgrounds, tables, frames, 
font types, font sizes, font shapes. Some of them are as follows;
1. Maintaining the identity of the website in each page 
This means preserving the identity of the web pages of a single website by 
keeping uniformity between backgrounds, font types, font sizes, font shapes etc.  2. Highlighting important information 
For this, methods such as changing the font types and font sizes or different 
colours in the related information can be adopted.3. Ability to access the website from any computer
Figure 5.6 - Various sizes of screensVarious users use different 
types of personal computers, various 
devices such as mobile phones to browse websites. Different sizes of screens are used as shown in Figure 5.6. Since the screen resolutions of these devices are different, some web pages are displayed in different ways on different screens. The website should be constructed in order to adjust the size of the webpage to that of the screen automatically.

For free distribution 132 For free distribution 1335.1.6  Selecting media resources
When selecting any type of media resource for a website such as various 
texts, pictures, sounds, videos and animations, several factors should be considered. 
The following are some such things to be considered;
1.  Size
There is a very close connection between the size of media resources 
accommodated to a certain web page and the time taken to download that web 
page. If the size of these is high, more time is spent to opening that web page as more data should be downloaded from the web server to the users' computer (client computer). Since the users have to stay for a long time to use the web page, there may be a possibility for them to leave the site. Therefore, various methods are followed depending on to the media type. Following are some examples;
 ²Graphics
 ◦Reducing the amount of pixels by removing unnecessary sections using Crop/Trim in graphics software
 ◦graphic compression
 ²Video files
 ◦Reducing frame size
 ◦Reducing resolution
 ◦Adjusting frame rate
 ◦Removing unnecessary frames and sound
 ²Audio files 
 ◦Reducing the bit rate
 ◦reducing the sample rate
 ◦reducing number of channels
 ◦removing or reducing unnecessary sound
2.  Use of media resources adhering copyrights
If you use media resources created by another person in your website, it 
is your responsibility to obtain necessary permission from the owner. If not, it is unethical and may lead to legal issues as well. 
However, as per the fair use of principles, it is possible to use media resources 
without permission for activities such as news reporting, academic purposes and critic.

5.1.7  Use of Basic HTML   
Hyper Text Markup Language, which is known as the acronym HTML, 
is the language used for documents in the World Wide Web. An HTML document which can be displayed through a web browser is called a web page. Unlike the computer programming languages you learnt earlier such as Pascal, the codes of HTML language shows the web browser how the web page content should be displayed on the computer screen. Hence, HTML is not a computer language but a Markup Language.   
Now let us design some simple web pages using HTML.

Step 5 - Instead of the phrases written on the notepad page in the second 
  step above “This is the title” and “My first web page”, write   different phrases and create more web pages.
Step 6 - Instead of using a word processing software like notepad, software
  which are called HTML editors can be used to write HTML code.
  Following are some software with the web addresses to download.
  1. CoffeeCup (www.coffeecup.com/html-editor)  2. Seamonkey Composer (www.seamonkey-project.org)  3. Eclipse (https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/html-editor-       wtp)

Observation
So far you have written HTML documents which include phrases 
of HTML language or HTML codes using notepad and other tools.
What you use in angular brackets like <html>, <head>, <title> are types of HTML tags, which is a main feature of HTML. These tags indicate to the web browser how the web page content should be displayed to the user. This means the structure and layout you have selected are entered in the web page using HTML tags. 
5.1.8 The Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Figure 5.13 given shows some essential tags in the basic structure of an 
HTML document. Mostly, a tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag. However, you will later come across some tags later which consist of an opening tag only.

Figure 5.13 - Basic structure of a HTML document
An HTML document consists of two main parts; head and body. The figure 
5.13 shows clearly that the opening <html> tag shows the opening of the document 
and the closing </html> tag shows the ending of the document. 
For free distribution 138
 For free distribution 139Web page content should be included in the body part. Consider how you 
indicated  “My first web page” in your first web page. 
There are special occasions where you make notes in the Head part. For 
instance, consider again how you mentioned “This is the title” in <title> tag in your 
first web page. This is displayed on Title Pane which is at the top most of your web page.
5.1.9 Features of HTML
i) HTML tags show the web browser how the web page should be displayed. Such commands in an HTML document are called HTML codes.
ii) There should be a pair of angular brackets (< >) at the beginning and end of an HTML tag.
  E.g. -  <p> to mark the beginning of a paragraph
iii) Generally, HTML closing tags are given in pairs. “/” (back slash) with the name 
of the tag should be indicated in the ending tag. 
E.g. -   <p> to mark the beginning of a paragraph and </p> to mark the end of                     it 
iv) Generally HTML tags are not case sensitive. That means, the use of capital or simple letters of the English language does not affect the meaning.
E.g. -  <TITLE>, <Title> or <title> does not make any difference.
v) There will be no error messages if the tag is indicated incorrectly, however, the web browser will ignore that particular.
vi) There are three parts of an HTML tag – element, attribute and value.
E.g. -     Following is the HTML code to display the plain text “I am a student”  
           in Times New Roman font type in blue colour. 
<font face=“iskoolaPota”   color = “blue” > I am a student </font>

Header tag Center tag Font tag
Figure 5.15 - HTML code to prepare the title text and its output
Let us consider the HTML tags further. 
Header tag
Methods such as increasing the font size, making the letters bold etc are 
used to highlight elements such as headings, sub-headings and other texts from the rest of the document. For a web page, this is carried out using the tag called header. There are header tags from <h1> to <h6> in the order. Out of these, <h1> makes the letters the biggest and the bold. The size and the thickness of the letters are decreased gradually from <h1> to <h6>.
Instead of <h2> tag of your web page, use other header tags and adjust the 
title to a proper size, after checking how it is displayed on the web page.   
Font tag
As you have learnt already, an HTML tag consists of three main components 
– element, attribute and value. There are three main attributes in the Font tag (ie.size, face and color). The font size attribute shows the size of the letters. For this, you can assign the values in the range from 1 to 7. Default is size 3. That is the size displayed automatically by the web browser when you do not assign a value to the Font size. 
Font face attribute shows the type of letters. You can assign any type of 
letters available in your computer as its value. E.g. - “Ariel”, “Verdana”
Font color attribute shows the colour of the letters. There are two ways to 
assign values for this.

Inserting Lists   
When a number of related items are indicated in an order, it is called a list. 
Mostly, these items are indicated one below the other. There are three types of main lists in web page designing in the HTML language. 
i)  Unordered lists
<ul> symbol is used to mark the beginning of an unordered list and the type 
attribute is used to show the shape of the special symbol with its element. Here are 
the three values which can be assigned to it.

if there are no attributes, this caption can be decorated using the tags related to text 
decoration. 
Example :  < Caption><b><u>Principle Forms of Land use </ u></ b></ Caption>
<tr> Tag   
This element, which is indicated as <tr>, adds a new row to the table. Just 
like in <table>, the attributes such as "align", "bgcolor", "border", "bordercolor" 
can be used differently for separate rows. 
Example :  <tr bordercolor = ''green'' bgcolor = ''yellow'' background = ''image.

<td> Tag
Used to create cells to include data in a row. Just like for rows, attributes can 
be added separately for cells as well. Example : <td  width = ''4'' bordercolor = ''green'' bgcolor = ''yellow'' background
       =''image.png''>Sometimes, cells should be merged adding several rows or columns of the 
table. There are two attributes used for this.1. Colspan - Used to create a cell merging several columns. The value of this 
attribute is the number of columns merged. 
Example :

For free distribution 156 For free distribution 1575.2 Web Designing Software
A sound knowledge of HTML language is essential in designing websites 
using simple word processors or HTML editors. Further HTML coding takes more 
time. Moreover, the basic HTML codes need changing for updates and alterations.
But, there are other web designing software which facilitate web designing 
quicker and more attractive. There the graphical user interface provides facilities to designing, editing, preview and upload.  As per the concept WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), you can create web pages in the same way you design them 
on the graphical user interface. 
There are various types of web designing software. For instance,1. Web authoring tools2. Content Management Systems (CMS)
5.2.1 web authoring tools
The special feature of this type of web designing software is that the relevant 
HLML document is automatically prepared in a separate interface while the 
designer is finishing the web page using a graphical user interface. If the designer has knowledge of HTML coding, web page designing can be done using graphical user interface as well as HTML document.
There are many open source web editors such as Kompozer, Ckeditor, 
Bluegriffon which can be downloaded from Internet while there are lots of web editors like Adobe dream viewer, Microsoft front page, Visual studio that are to be purchased.

5.2.2 Static websites and dynamic websites 
There are two types of websites according to the nature of its content as 
static and dynamic.
1.Static Websites
If the content of a website is maintained without any change over a period 
of time, such a website is called a static website. Normally, websites based on 
HTML language are static websites. Their structure and content are designed using HTML codes. The web content can be changed only by changing the code.
This kind of websites can be designed in a very simple way as a collection 
of a number of web pages. Users are not directly connected to the web server when using the websites. Only the designer of the website can enter the relevant changes by connecting to the web server where the website is hosted. These websites are safer even though it consumes more time for coding.
Websites that were created so far using word processing software, HTML 
editor, web editor etc are static web sites.
2.Dynamic Websites
If the web content is often changed, such a website is called a dynamic 
website. These are designed using software such as PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), 
ASP.net (Active Server Page.net), JSP(Java Server Page). Here the web server generates information using a data base or program. 
Example:
1. Current time is displayed as dynamic in a website.2. Showing results of a candidate related to the index number.
For free distribution 160 For free distribution 161Users are directly connected to the web server while using such websites. 
Information is exchanged from the user to web server or vice versa. Hence, the 
security of the website is threatened compared to a static website.
This is more appropriate for commercial, social or exam holding websites 
which should be often changed. However, higher knowledge and experience are required to build such websites in a protective way.
Server Client/browserStatic
Web server Database server  Client/browserDynamic
Figure 5.42 - Static and dynamic websites
5.2.3 Content Management Systems (CMS)
CMS can be defined as software used for dynamic website designing, content 
management and publishing. It is possible for the web designer to re-publish his website often changing its content.
Web designing and managing using CMS is very easy and fast, while 
no prior knowledge of computer languages is required. Hence, CMS is the most popular web designing tool at present.
The creativity of designing is limited to a certain range if various audio 
visual information is entered to the website using templates and wizards provided by the software. All the websites that are designed this way will be monotonous. This weakness can be largely avoided by changing relevant codes if you possess a sound knowledge of computer languages such as HTML, PHP, javascript, CSS, SQL.

 For free distribution 163Some open code CMS software with their web addresses are as follows.
1. Joomla (www.joomla.org/download.html)
2. Wordpress (www.wordpress.org/download)
3. Drupal (www.drupal.org/download)
How a website is designed using a CMS software
You can design this website using any CMS software you prefer and the 
steps to install ''Joomla'' software are as follows.
Step 01 - Install the three types of software given below in your computer. 
  The web addresses required to download these are also given.
1. APACHE (www.apache.org)
2. PHP(www.php.net)3.MySql (www.mysql.com)
However, it is easier to install a single package which includes all the above 
two such software are as follows.
1. WAMP (www.wampserver.com)2. XAMPP (www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
Step 02 -  Download Joomla software from www.joomla.org website and 
  install it in your computer. Since there are lots of steps here, get   necessary advice from a suitable website. 
  Example - https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Installing_Joomla

Designing a website for a certain institute and maintaining it while keeping 
it updated is a team work involving in many people. Each person has a role to play 
with the relevant tasks and many responsibilities. Let us identify some important roles among those.
1. Author - Designs interfaces of the website 
2. Editor - Writes codes, checks errors and rectifies those.3. Publisher - Fulfills tasks related to the publishing of the website.4.Administrator - Fulfills maintenance tasks related to the web server and 
database.
5. Users - Use the website.
 5.3 Publication of a website 
Publication of a website includes the tasks such as designing website, 
hosting, updating and posting etc. There are several requirements a web publisher should fulfill for this. 
1. A web designing software2. A web host3. A domain name4. File transfer protocol5. Internet connection
5.3.1 Web Host
The designed website should be hosted in a place where any person 
can access at any time from any place through Internet. Such service providing 
computers are called web hosts.
If the website is designed for a mass scale institute, normally they have their 
own dedicated host. If it is for a small scale institute, they get space from shared hosts maintained by other institutes. Shared hosts charge basic fee and annual charge according to the allocated capasity. There are many institutes in Sri Lanka as well as in the world which provide such web host services.
There are institutes which provide web host services free of charge as well. 
You can get this facility through various websites. Here, their advertisements are also displayed in your website.
For free distribution 164
 For free distribution 165Activity
Name two institutes which provide free web host services along with 
their relevant web addresses.
5.3.2 Domain Name
National identity number is given to each and every person in the world to 
identify a person uniquely.
In the same way, there is a system to find a website in the World Wide Web. 
It is known as ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) 
that bears the responsibility of assigning and administrating domain names for websites. After designing a website, it should be registered in that institute with a suitable domain name. Some of such other institutes are as follows.   
1. www.godaddy.com2. www.bluehost.com3. ww.nic.lk
It is more appropriate to get registered paying a basic fee. Registration 
should be renewed paying an annual fee. Sometimes, it is done by the person who is responsible for hosting. However, if you need to host your website in another web host later, this can create issues on registration. Hence, it is more appropriate if the publisher himself registers the website.
Things to consider when selecting a domain name to a website.
1. It is appropriate to give a certain identification about the institute the website 
belongs to or the objective of preparing the website through the domain name. 
This makes the users easier to find the website through search engines.  
Example: The web address www.nie.lk indicates the institute the website
belongs to the user by the domain name “nie”.
2.According to the nature of the website, top level domain names such as “.com”, “.edu”, “.org”,“.lk” can be attached.
Example: The top level domain name “.org” of the web address www.wikipedia.org indicates that it belongs to non commercial type websites.
 Organizational hierarchy Geographic hierarchy
.(Root)
com edu ukfrpespjpcdgr... mil gov net ... ...
Figure 5.43 - Domain names of websites
For free distribution 164 For free distribution 1653.If the domain name is short, it is easy for the user to remember it as well as to 
type it accurately.
4.It is not appropriate to include numbers, lines, in domain name. The reason for this is when the web address is read orally, it may not be communicated correctly to the listener.
Example:
Reader Listener
www.myweb2.org www.mywebtu.org
Activity
Visit www.nic.lk and study the steps to obtain .lk domain name. 
5.3.3 File Transfer Protocol/FTP
These are the software used to transfer the website you have designed to the 
selected web host according to the international standards. These can be purchased or downloaded free from Internet.
Example - 1. Filezilla (https://filezilla-project.org)
  2. SmartFTP (https://www.smartftp.com)
Since most of the web designing tools include file transfer facility as well, 
another software is not needed. Further, the institutes which provide shared host 
services too provide the facility of file transferring.
5.3.4 Internet Connection
Internet connection is essential for the three steps of publishing a website 
– transferring, updating and path declaration. Internet connection is the medium which connects the users with the web host.
A proper Internet service provider should be selected to get Internet 
connection. Things such as the speed of the connection, charges, and maintenance services should be considered here.
Some Internet service providers in Sri Lanka are as follows..
1. Sri Lanka Telecom
2. Lanka Bell3. Mobitel4.Dialog Axiata
For free distribution 166
 For free distribution 1675.3.5 Maintenance of Website
Regular maintenance is an essential factor for the success of a website. This 
can be explained from several aspects.
1.Depending on the nature of the website, its content should be updated daily, 
weekly or monthly. Not only should the content of the website be changed here, but also the way it is presented, pictures, colours, shapes and other objects should be changed. By maintaining a column on the Home Page to publish new information, current changes can be updated instantly.
2.Harmful software like viruses, unauthorized access can create the website malfunction. Hence, regular attention should be paid, while getting back up time to time and proper security methods should be followed.
3.If there are new versions of the software used to design the website, website should be updated accordingly. It is important for the security of the website.

and organize it well with the proper content which suits the needs of the users of the web site.
 ²Depending on the content, there are two types of web sites – static and dynamic.
 ²HTML is the basic language used for web designing. Knowledge of this language is essential to be a successful web editor. This makes writing HTML codes easier.
 ²Simple web sites can be designed even without any knowledge of HTML language, using the software such as web authoring tools and Content Management Systems.

For free distribution 170 For free distribution 171These issues and likely solutions are detailed in the following sub-section.
6.2.1  Legal issues
Figure 6.9 -  Data theftsi) Data thefts -
  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
stolen from a computer or other device can be 
considered as data theft.E.g. - stealing or keeping flash drives, digital  
 camera, mobile phones that contain  
 personal names, telephone numbers,  
 photos etc. without permission or legal  
   rights.
ii) Unauthorized access into computer systems -       
  It is possible to access computer systems unlawfully with the theft of or 
manipulating user name and password of a computer.  An organization's data 
can easily be stolen in this manner.
iii)  Intellectual property rights -
1. What are intellectual property rights?  
Intellectual  property usually relates to mind creations. Intellectual property 
rights relate to an innovation or a completely new product from a person or an organization currently. Such innovations or brand new products to enter the market are the property of the first person or organization to develop and release the product. They claim ownership to the innovation. It is their right to identify themselves as the legal or lawful owners.   
Presenting such products in the names of others or using such products 
for other developments or sale of such products without the knowledge of the first person or organization is illegal. Such claims belong to the category of stolen intellectual property.
2.  It is possible to obtain patent rights for protection of intellectual property.
A patent is a license issued by the State for innovations. To receive a patent 
license the innovator must apply to the national office governing patents.
iv)  Fraud 
Computer fraud is any dishonest misinterpretation of fact intended to let 
another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. The fraud will 
result in obtaining a benefit by, for example:

• Altering, destroying, suppressing or stealing output to conceal unauthorized 
transactions
Identity theft: deliberate use of someone else's identity as a method to 
gain a financial advantage. (e.g. someone using another's Personally Identifying Information, NIC numbers, credit card numbers etc. without permission to commit fraud.
6.2.2  Issues related to values
Figure 6.10 - Plagiarismi) Plagiarism  Plagiarism is the act of stealing another’s 
creative work and displaying it as one’s own. Plagiarism is very common among users of computers today with the stealing of data and other related information from the Internet.  
  It is possible to use data and other 
information collected from the Internet in better accepted ways. Better accepted ways refer to the correct use of such 
collected information without in any way harming the reputation of the correct owner. This, can be done by, 
1. citing - mentioning the rightful owner and his/her information.2.quoting - the use of inverted commas (“…”) to identify a selected or borrowed section.  
3.referencing - the listing of resources from which the information was collected.  This is usually done at the end of an essay or article.
6.2.3  Physical and logical issues
Computers need to be used carefully. Careless use of computers is likely to 
bring about both physical and logical issues.
Sudden power failures may lead to damaged computing devices. There may 
be computer thieves. It is also possible to experience a complete network breakdown with malware coming through the Internet. Environmental factors also contribute towards physical damage to computers.  
If so, how can computers be made secure to free ourselves from physical 
and logical issues that are likely to arise?
For free distribution 172 For free distribution 173 ¾Physical Security
i) Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) 
  In case of an electricity breakdown, there has to be some alternate 
arrangement to supply power to the computer so that the network and the documents face no harm. Here, the alternate arrangement to supply comes with the battery contained in a UPS. This prevents interruption to the supply of power to the computer.(Fig. 6.11).
Figure 6.11 - Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)Computer
UPSMain Supply
ii) Hardware Firewalls  Hardware firewalls bought as a separate unit have now been built into 
broadband routers. Hardware firewalls are essential especially with computer networks connected to the Internet. A firewall protects a network from unauthorized access to or from a network by filtering data that pass through it. All messages entering or leaving a network pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not security criteria (fig. 6.12)

Closed and locked doors are essential to ensure 
security of a computer laboratory. Closed and locked 
doors prevent or limit unlawful entry of people. It can also improve safety of computer systems and other accessories while protecting the information contained (Fig 6.13).
Figure 6.14 - CCTV  iv) CCTV  It is possible to install CCTV cameras inside a 
computer laboratory and monitor movement from outside or arrange for the day’s proceedings to be recorded as a video clip for viewing later (Fig. 6.14).
   
v) Su rge protector
  The surge protector 
protects computers and other 
accessories inside a laboratory  by controlling the voltage in the power supply. The local voltage supply for houses or offices is 230 V . The surge protector acts in situations where the power supply exceeds this limit, to control the destruction  that could happen to electronic devices (Fig 6.15).
 Figure 6.16 - Environmental factorsvi) Environmental factors
Environmental factors can affect the 
proper function of a computer. Therefore, it is important to maintain a laboratory or a private computer in a safe environment free from dirt, dust, moisture and the like (Fig 6.16).

Figure 6.17 - Passwords i)  Passwords
  Passwords are used to secure data 
stored in a computer. Passwords protect unauthorized entry or use of a computer. In using a password, it is advisable to mix letters, symbols and numbers to make the password stronger. (Fig. 6.17)
 Figure 6.18 - Software Firewallsii) Software Firewalls 
Software firewalls are installed on a computer (like any software) and can be customized by the user. A software firewall will protect a computer from outside attempts to control or gain access to it (Fig. 6.18).
Figure 6.19 - Backupsiii) Backups  In the event of a failure of a computer 
system, essential data and information in the computer can be lost. Therefore, a backup is essential towards securing protection of data and information. A backup can be maintained in an external hard disk, CD, DVD, a flash drive or a memory chip. It is also advisable to keep such backups securely in another physical location. (Fig 6.19)

 ²Destruction or mal-function of software 
 ²Inability to install other software
 ²Weaken computer hardware
 ²Sabotage of computer networks
 ²Data theft and destruction  
 ²Reduction of the storage capacity of the hard disk by storing unnecessary documents and files.
Harmful software and resultant damage
A few types of harmful software and resultant damage are as described in the Table.
Harmful software Resultant damage
Computer Virus Computer viruses gain entry into the computer through a computer program and spread rapidly within the computer causing enough harm. Viruses can enter a computer through networks, a USB flash drive, external devices like memory chips, or through e-mail. Viruses enter the system as executable files. In other words the viruses always remain active within the computer.  
Computer Worms Computer worms also act similar to computer viruses.  Worms, however, are capable of acting and spreading alone using e-mail attachments, false websites and instant messages. 
For free distribution 176 For free distribution 177Spyware Trojan Horse
The Trojan Horse is a harmful software based on the Greek Trojan Horse constructed using wood. It presents itself as harmless and enters the system without the knowledge of the user. Trojan Horse spyware makes the user uncomfortable by unnecessary opening up windows, producing different desktops, deleting documents and stealing data. Further, it allows other harmful software to gain entry. Trojan  enters computer with e mail attachments. However, unlike computer viruses and worms, the Trojan Horse does not spread by itself.   
Adware
The adware is displaying unnecessary notices on the computer screen. Using these advertisements, adware collects commercial information. Adware is not harmful as other computer viruses but disturbs the user mentally.
Bots Bots are derived from the word ‘robots’. Bots is harmful software that functions on its own communicating with other networks. Bots are used to collect personal information through Internet messages and conversations.  
Hijacker/ Browser 
HijackerHijacker/Browser Hijacker is capable of misdirecting a user to a different website through the Internet, to collect information regarding trade, commerce and advertisements. Hijacker, is similar to adware.  
Phishing Phishing is the art of deceiving users to collect information about bank accounts or electronic accounts.  E-mail is used for the purpose.  Such mail is sent through a popular organization or a friend together with a link for access. With a click on the link, or by filling forms, valuable information and cash deposits related to the unsuspecting user get stolen.        
Spam Spam is unauthorized e-mail. Most often, spam relates to advertisements about products or a mail from an unknown person. The mail box can get filled with such mail and make the user uncomfortable. Also, Spam may collect e-mail addresses that can be used unlawfully for frauds.

Agencies in Sri Lanka responsible for the security of information exchange
  There is hardly any individual or an organization in Sri Lanka who/which 
is not connected to the Internet. Over the last few years, unauthorized access into social networks, financial websites has been observed over the world. Sri Lanka is no exception. Therefore, the necessity for responsible agencies to secure Internet access has arisen. This is also called ‘Cyber Security’. 
  Cyber security is not limited to e-mail, Internet solutions, or social 
networks. They are useful for personal networks and operating systems (OS). Some organizations responsible for cyber security are as follows.

    Technology
 ²Ergonomics and health issues
Ergonomics is a word made with the use of two words in the Greek 
Language. According to Greek Language “ergon” is job or action. “nomos” is  law. Therefore, the simple meaning to be collected from this word is:
“a job must be created to the comfort of the worker and the worker must not be forced to adjust himself/herself to the work. If not, the worker will subject himself/ herself to various tensions and illnesses.” 
As of today, technology has become indispensable to mankind. Technology 
and mankind are now interconnected as inseparable. Daily, the numbers using technology keep increasing. As a result, technology related health issues too keep increasing. Issues arise as a result of the continuous use of a computer for over four hours at a stretch.  Let us take a look at these health issues:
Figure 6.21 - Musculoskeletal 
problemsi)   Musculoskeletal Problems  Non-stop use of a computer can bring about 
pain in different muscles and bones of the human system. The main reason for this is the wrong posture taken with the use of the computer (Fig 6.21).
Figure 6.22 - Repetitive Stress 
Injuryii)  RSI – Repetitive Stress Injury  Repetitive stress injury is the pain extending 
from the shoulder to the fingers of the body.  The affected areas can show swelling and hardness that brings out the pain. The difficulty to move the mouse is a result of this pain. The cause of the pain is incorrect posture (Fig. 6.22).

Tunnel Syndromeiii)  CTS – Carpel Tunnel Syndrome   (Fig.6.23)
       Carpel tunnel syndrome is the feeling of 
a numbness and pain in the fingers. The pain arises due to the pressure exerted on the wrist.  Incorrect use of the key board and the mouse or placing them in the incorrect positions are reasons for the syndrome.
Figure 6.24 - Computer Vision 
Syndromeiv)  CVS - Computer Vision Syndrome • 
      Sticking to the computer continuously 
for 6 to 7 hours can cause irritation of the eyes and is identified as the Computer Vision Syndrome.  Dry eyes, redness in the eyes, tearing, blurred vision, or pain in the head, neck or back are symptoms of the discomfort. (Fig.6.24)
Figure 6.25 - Headachev) Headache
    Pressure on the muscles of the neck 
and tiredness around the eyes usually cause headaches to users of computers. (Fig. 6.25)

1. Keeping the computer on a suitable table at eye level or a little lower.
2.The distance between the computer screen and the eye to be 18 – 28 inches or 45 – 70 cm.
3.Keeping the user’s back straight against the back of the chair and keeping shoulders relaxed.
4.Keeping legs vertical to the ground with the soles flat on the surface.
5.Keeping the mouse near the computer, keying in words lightly, moving wrist as is necessary while keeping the keyboard straight at elbow level or lower.
To adhere to these movements:  
 ²Adjust light on the computer to make the eyes comfortable
 ²Blink and take eyes off the screen on and off
 ²Take a break in between work, walk short distances
 ²Fix playtime sessions for children and direct them to other activities
 ²People using computers at work for 7 to 8 hours need to refrain from using computers at home and maintain a relaxed mind.
Followers of these procedures are unlikely to face health issues.

6.2.7  Social issues related with ICT
Figure 6.30 - Digital divide Hey, Mr. Jhonson..Mr. Jhonson?
i) Digital divide  
  Digital divide is an economic and 
social inequality due to the differences in access to, ability to or use of Information Communication Technology.
For free distribution 184 For free distribution 185Some of the reasons for the digital divide are as follows;
 ²Education 
 ²Ability to use technology 
 ²Affluence
 ²Industrial development  
 ²Suburban ²Lack of education 
 ²Inability to use technology
 ²Poverty
 ²Under industrial development
 ²Rural
Figure 6.31
 ²Education/Lack of education  - Ignorance regarding the benefits of 
Information Communication Technology  and their use create differences 
among individuals.
 ²Availability/Unavailability of technical know-how - There is little possibility  of connection between people who are knowledgeable of and make good use of  Information Communication technology with those who are totally ignorant of Information Communication Technology or their uses.
 ²Affluence/Poverty - Even though, there is a need and the necessity to learn and 
use ICT, afford ability becomes a matter for denied.
 ²Industrial development/under industrial development - Industrialization of 
a country is a reason for the use of Information Communication Technology. Non-industrialization leads to a digital divide between countries.
 ²Suburban/Rural - Those leading urban lives are very busy and use Information Communication Technology heavily. On the other hand, those leading simple lives freely in rural areas simply do not care for the use of Information Communication Technology. As a result, there arises a digital divide between people.
ii) Digital Bridge -  Digital bridge is forming connections among people avoiding 
the digital divide. However, it is not possible to create a digital bridge by providing each and everyone with a computer or a mobile phone.  It is necessary for people to acquire different technological products, get to know them and learn how to use them effectively. Otherwise, the technology may become meaningless and lose value.

 ²Digital Literacy – Acquiring ICT Knowledge helps get over a digital divide. 
Establishing places such as, Vidatha centres, Nenasala centres, Computer Resource Centers to provide free use of computers or at low cost in different parts of the country, can contribute towards overcoming a digital divide. To promote the use of such centres, there need to be mobile publicity, delivery of handouts and poster displays.  
The benefits of digital literacy are as follows:
 ◦Realization of the need of using ICT resulting in an urge to use it
 ◦Helps overcome issues arising from the use of ICT as far as possible.
 ◦Realizes the value of using the Internet for payment of bills, doing research and collecting information about education, being aware of information related to modern medicine and in applying for jobs. 
 ²Supply of computers - Digital literacy is the foundation of the digital bridge.  Organizing the purchase of computers at easy concessionary rates can increase the literacy rate in a country. It helps not only those anxious to gain digital literacy but also other members of such families as well.
 ²Equal opportunities to dispel other financial difficulties - Making it possible for everyone to access the Internet for free on a reasonable payment and clearing all obstacles towards this process. Easy access to the Internet for everybody will certainly help school children of all ages to collect necessary information for their study purposes while making online education possible. It will also provide opportunities for employment, observe market trends, exchange information through social networks and related concerns.

iii) De-Skilling
Figure 6.33 
De-skilling is also one of the effects of using ICT. (Fig. 7.33) Machinery or 
automation has taken over skilled labour in places of work, driving people away towards unemployment. It is easy to direct and maintain machinery at work. However, the chances lost by skilled workers are enormous and have made them helpless.  
People and organizations have a wealth of knowledge collected over 
the years. All this knowledge is wasted with the shift to machinery. Further, the change does not allow for more knowledge and allows for lost opportunities. These contribute  to the disadvantages of automation.  
A few such examples are discussed below:
 ²Machinery has taken over the industry replacing the talents of people.
 ²Libraries have been made to close down and jobs in the sector lost due to the electronic books and magazines.
 ²Online learning through the distance mode has limited teacher resources.
 ²Health concerns are easily sorted out from home itself, cutting down the job opportunities in laboratory services

 ²Desktop/Applications Support Specialist
 ²Mobile Application Developer
 ²Network and Systems Security Specialist
 ²Network Managers and Administrator
 ²Software Engineer
 ²Technical Sales Specialists
 ²Technical Trainer
 ²Telecom manager 
 ²Telecommunications Line Installer
 ²Website Developers
But of these, Software Engineers are the most in demand, locally and 
globally. At present, Software Engineers employed abroad have come to be the largest contributors towards foreign exchange earnings. This is due to the Software Engineers being a highly paid employment opportunity. Therefore, being highly educated about the development of software as well as ICT can certainly help you win prosperity with highly paid employment opportunities.

a fertile breeding ground towards connecting 
people globally, cultivating associations and grouping like-minded people towards exchanging personal information and opinions on related topics of interest. Given below are a few services social media provide.
 ²Promote one’s products profitably
 ²Blogs – Blogs are a shortened term for We b logs and refer to routing personal 
diaries or magazines. These web logs are created for people to present their daily experiences or about happenings that could cause harm to society. On reading web logs others too can contribute opinions.
 ²Social media helps attract people using the Internet to one’s own website, product detailing websites or blogs.
 ²Forum – Forums are routine discussion panels. Forum provides a good opportunity for people to openly express common opinion.  Forum is another service from social media.
 ²It has become increasingly possible for social media to connect people from different parts of the globe share opinions, participate in lively discussions, exchange images, video clips, and songs.
ii) Cyber crime
However, irresponsible use of social media has engendered misconduct in 
society. This irresponsible use is identified as cyber crime. A few such acts are as described.
 ²Uploading others’ images without permission
 ²Releasing unsuitable photographs or videos of  women or young girls to the Internet and making use of such images or videos to frighten, threaten or blackmail
 ²Giving publicity to information that can harm a person’s reputation
 ²Misleading people with wrong information and images about others published on the Internet  to cause personal discomfort 
 ²Using social media to give out false information and, thereby attract others to finally destroy lives 
 ²Using unfair means to gain access to others’ personal accounts and stealing personal information.
