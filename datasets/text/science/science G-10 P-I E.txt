Being innovative, changing with right knowledge
Be a light to the country as well as to the world.
Message from the Hon. Minister of Education
The past two decades have been significant in the world history due to changes 
that took place in technology. The present students face a lot of new challenges along with the rapid development of Information Technology, communication and other related fields. The manner of career opportunities are liable to change specifically in the near future. In such an environment, with a new technological and intellectual society, thousands of innovative career opportunities would be created. To win those challenges, it is the responsibility of the Sri Lankan government and myself, as the Minister of Education, to empower you all. 
This book is a product of free education. Your aim must be to use this book 
properly and acquire the necessary knowledge out of it. The government in turn is able to provide free textbooks to you, as a result of the commitment and labour of your parents and elders.
Since we have understood that the education is crucial in deciding the future 
of a country, the government has taken steps to change curriculum to suit the rapid changes of the technological world. Hence, you have to dedicate yourselves to become productive citizens. I believe that the knowledge this book provides will suffice your aim. 
It is your duty to give a proper value to the money spent by the government on 
your education. Also you should understand that education determines your future. Make sure that you reach the optimum social stratum through education.
I congratulate you to enjoy the benefits of free education and bloom as an 
honoured citizen who takes the name of Sri Lanka to the world.

viiIntroduction
This textbook was compiled by the Educational Publications Department in 
accordance with the syllabus prepared by the National Institute of Education for 
the use of Grade 10 students in the Sri Lankan school system with effect from 2015.
An effort has made here to arrange the subject content to suit the the national 
educational goals, common national competencies, the objectives of teaching science and the content of the syllabus.
The subject of science directs the student towards a more active learning 
process in a manner as to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for a developmental scientific thought.
Each chapter is compiled based on the three main subject areas that comprise 
the Science subject; Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Pictures, charts, graphs, activities and assignments are included to enable the easy understanding of the related concepts of the subject.
At the end of each chapter, a summary was included and it provides the 
opportunity to identify the basic concepts of each chapter and to revise the subject matter. Furthermore, there is a series of exercises at the end of each chapter. It will contribute to measure the expected learning outcomes through a self evaluation.
Activities, self evaluative questions, solved examples, assignments and 
exercises are planned in a manner as to develop the higher order skills such as  It enables the students to develop knowledge as well as the higher order skills such as comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.
For the purpose of directing the student to study further about the subject 
matter, more information is included in the “For extra knowledge”. It is given only to broaden the subject area of the child and certainly not to ask questions at term tests.
Some of the activities mentioned in the textbook could be performed at home 
and some of them should be performed in the science laboratory of the school. Activity based learning helps to create a liking towards learning science in the students and it will easily establish the concepts.
We would like to bestow our sincere thanks on Professor T.R.Ariyarathne, 
Professor J.K.D.S. Jayanetti of the Department of Physics, University of Colombo, Professor Shamala Thirimanna of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Colombo and the Chief Project Officer (Retired) W.D.Wijesinghe of the National Institute of Education and the Retired Principal H.S.K.

The bodies of all organisms are composed of variety of chemical compounds. These 
chemical compounds are formed by the bonding of naturally existing elements in different ways.
There are only about 25 elements in the living body out of the 92 elements present 
in  nature. They are present at different locations in the body in different forms.
The most common 4 elements in the living body are Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and 
Nitrogen. Other than above Sulphur, Phosphorous, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron and Chlorine are essential for the survival of organisms.

Chemical compounds that build up living matter can be divided into two categories 
as organic compounds and inorganic compounds. Compounds which contain Carbon 
are known as organic compounds and compounds which do not contain Carbon are 
known as inorganic compounds. (Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide,Carbonates and Bicarbonates are some of the inorganic compounds which contain Carbon) Those organic compounds that build up the living body or living matter are known as bio molecules. They are:
 ² Carbohydrates
 ² Proteins ² Lipids ² Nucleic acids
These are considered as the main types of bio molecules. Instead of these four

■ Enzymes
The special proteins (organic catalysts) that are produced within the organism to increase the rate of bio-chemical reactions are known as enzymes.
For example to convert Sucrose into Glucose, S ucrose has to be heated with a dilute 
acid. But the enzymes present in the digestive system do the same reaction at a low 
temperature.
Therefore the activity of enzyme is to catalyze the bio-chemical reactions.Engage in the following activity on how enzymes function.
Activity of Amylase on Starch
Materials required 
Flour, Amylase, Test tube, white porcelain tile, Iodine solution, Water, 
A stop watch  
Method
 y Put 2ml of Starch solution into a test tube. 
 y Add 2ml of Amylase (Filter a solution of ground germinating green gram 
(Mung) seedlings) into it and mix well.
 y Get a drop from the solution after 2 minutes and place it on a white 
porcelain tile. 
 y Add a drop of Iodine onto the drop of mixture.
 y Continue same procedure for about 20 minutes in 2 minute intervals.Activity - 01
The blue colour of the drop obtained from the mixture gradually reduces with 
time and finally obtains the colour of Iodine (yellow /brown colour) 
Starch gives black blue colour with Iodine but it does not give colour change 
with Iodine after 20 minutes as there is no Starch there.That is because Starch is 
converted to Maltose by Amylase enzyme.

Similar to carbohydrates, fats also contain Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen as 
constituent elements.  But a lipid contains much less oxygen than a carbohydrate.Lipids are insoluble in polar solvents including water. They are soluble in organic solvents.
Ground nut, coconut, gingelly, butter and margarine are examples for foods which 
contain lipids. 
Fatty acids and glycerol react to form Lipids.

• Significance of Lipids
 y As an energy source
Lipids act as an energy source as carbohydrates and proteins. More energy 
is produced during burning of lipids.
 y To form different structural components
Lipid is one of the most important compounds in cell membrane. (Specially phospho lipids and cholesterol)
 y For conservation of water
The wax known as cutin present on the surface of the plant body conserve water. Most animals' body covering also contains wax which helps to avoid desiccation as it is impermeable to water.
 y To maintain the body temperature
Warm blooded animals such as birds and mammals possess a hypodermal fat layer which acts as a thermal insulator. It helps to maintain their body temperature.
 y To protect internal body organs
The fat layer surrounds the organs and structures in the body and absorbs 
external shocks. Thereby provides protection.
 y To synthesize some hormones
Some Hormones of vertebrates (Oestrogen, Testosterone, Cortisone) are 
lipid compounds.

Fatty acids can be divided into two groups as follows.
              fatty acids
saturated fatty acids                           unsaturated fatty acids
Saturated fatty acids 
fatty acids which contain only single bonds within Carbon atoms are called 
saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids exist in room temperature as solids or semi-solids. 
Unsaturated fatty acids
fatty acids which contain one or several double bonds within Carbon 
atoms are called unsaturated fatty acids.
Unsaturated fatty acids exist in room temperature as liquids.

2.1 Distance and displacement
Distance is a concept familiar to you.  When you go from home to school, you have 
to travel  a certain distance.  Sometimes, there can be several paths you could use to 
travel between home and school.  Some of them could be shorter and some longer.
Figure 2.1 shows several paths that a child could take, to travel from a point A to 
another point B.
B Adistance  200 m
Eastdistance  320 m
distance  160 m
distance  240 mpath Rpath P
path Q
     
Figure 2.1 – Several paths between points A to B 
If path P is used, the distance between point A to point B would be 320 m.  If path Q
is used, this distance would be 200 m.  If path R is taken, the travel distance would 
be 240 m.  This shows that the distance depends not only on the starting and the end 
points, but also on the path used to traverse the distance.
Whichever the path the child uses to reach B after starting from A, the ultimate result 
is that he has moved a distance of 160 m from A to B on a straight line towards the 
east . A change of  position like this, that occurs from one point to another point in 
a particular direction is called displacement. The magnitude of the displacement is the shortest distance between the two points. 
24 25A  physical quantity which can be described only by its magnitude is called a 
scalar quantity.
eg: speed, mass, time, distance 
A physical quantity which can be described by its magnitude and direction is 
called a vector quantity. 
eg: displacement, acceleration, velocity, weight
In the example above, the displacement of the child is 160 m to the east.  Although 
the distance has changed according to the path taken, the displacement has remained the same.
In addition, there is another important difference between distance and displacement.
Because we do not take the direction into account when measuring the distance,  distance has only a magnitude. It does not have a direction.  Therefore, distance is a scalar quantity.  However,  when measuring the displacement, the direction is important. In other words, the displacement has both a magnitude and a direction.  Therefore it is a vector quantity.
Let us understand this concept further with following examples.
(i)  Black colour arrow in the figure 2.2 shows the path taken by a child to travel  
from home to school. 
Figure 2.2 - Path taken by a child to travel 
from home to schoolhome
schoolTotal distance that the child has 
travelled between home and 
school is
=AB + BC + CD = 100 m + 400 m
+ 200 m = 700 mHowever, the straight line distance from home to school is 500 m.  This means that the magnitude of the displacement is 500 m while its direction is along AD.2

path indicated by the arrows.   
      
                                      
Even though the distance travelled by the child along this path is 400 m, the magnitude of his displacement is 120 m and the direction is along AB.
(iii)  A 200 m running track used in track events is shown in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.5 – Finding the direction of

An athlete who runs in this track from A to B reaches the point B after running 
a distance of 200 m.   Then the  displacement of the athlete can  be indicated  by 
the straight line AB.  The magnitude of his displacement is 160 m.  Its direction 
according to Figure 2.5 is 70o  from the north to west. This displacement can be 
expressed in the following manner.         
        
160 m in the direction 700  from north to west.
26 27 (iv)  Now consider a situation where a child is walking 60 m from A to B along the  
straight line path as shown in Figure 2.6.
A B C
60 m 40 m
Figure 2.6 – Path of a child walking from A
The displacement of the child is 60 m along AB. Thereafter, if the child walks 
another 40 m along the same direction and reaches point C, what would be his total displacement?
When two or more displacements occur along the same direction, they can be either 
added or subtracted using ordinary arithmetic.
Since the displacements in the above example are in the same direction, total 
displacement   = 60 m + 40 m = 100 m
This means that the child is now at a point 100 m away on a straight line from the 
starting point. 
Now suppose that the child walks back 40 m after reaching the point B, as shown 
in Figure 2.7, instead of walking forward. The displacement corresponding to 40 m 
is in the opposite direction to that of AB. According to the figure 2.7 it is clear that the total displacement is given by the line AC.  Therefore, although the distance traversed in this case too is 100 m, his displacement would be 60 m + (-40 m).  That is 20 m.
A B60 m
40 m
Figure 2.7 – Walking back 40 m after reaching point B  
If he walked the same distance in the opposite direction after reaching the point B, 
his displacement would be 60 m + (-60 m).  That is, a zero (0) displacement.  From this we know that the child is back at the starting point.C
26 27A child starts from a point A and walks 40 m to the East until he reaches 
another point B and from B he walks 30 m to the North to reach the point C

2.2 Speed
We frequently hear about accidents caused by vehicles moving at high speeds.  
Due to this reason, there are different regulatory 
speed limits assigned to different roadways.  We should  obey  these speed limits in order to prevent accidents, particularly in highways with high speed limits.
What we mean by speed is the  rate at which a 
given distance is traversed.
 
In other words, speed is the distance traversed in a unit time.speed = distance 
     time
28 29Vehicles moving in roadways cannot maintain the same speed throughout the travel 
time. The speedometer of a motor vehicle usually indicates only the speed of the vehicle at a particular instant. When there is heavy traffic, vehicles have to slow down, and when there are pedestrians crossing the road, the vehicles even have to stop.  On the other hand, if there are only a few other vehicles in the road, the same speed can be maintained for a fairly long distance.  Let us consider two such instances, one where the same speed is maintained, and the other where the speed changes with time, through the following examples.
The distance traversed by a certain object at different instances in time is shown in 
the table below.
Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Distance traversed  d (m) 0 3 6 9 12 15 18
According to these data, 
Distance traversed by the object during the first second  = (3 - 0) = 3 m
         Distance traversed during the next second  = (6 - 3) = 3 m
Similarly, the distances traversed during each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth 
seconds is also 3 m.
That is, the object has traversed 3 m during each 1 s time interval. Therefore, in this 
case we can say that the object has moved at a uniform or constant speed.
timedistancespeed=Since the time is given in seconds and the distance in meters, the speed has the unit ms
-1 (    ). Accordingly, the above object 
has a speed of 3 m s-1.
Now let us consider the motion of another object described by the following data table.
Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Distance traversed d (m) 0 3 5 9 12 16 18
The distance traversed by this object is 3 m in first second, 2 m in second second 
and 4 m in third second etc.sm
28 29Therefore the distance traversed by this object during each interval of one second is 
not the same.  That is, this object has not travelled with a uniform speed.
In such instances, where an object does not travel with a uniform speed, it is useful 
to calculate the mean speed of the object during a given time interval.  The mean speed of an object can be calculated by dividing the total distance travelled, by the corresponding time interval.  Mean speed is also known as the average speed.
mean speed or average speed =
duration   time total travelled distance  total
The total distance travelled by this object during 6 s is 18 m.  Therefore, the average 
distance travelled during a second = 18
63 = m.     
That is, the mean speed or average speed of the object      
   
As another example, let us consider a vehicle  that travelled a distance of 100 km 
from a location near Colombo to Peradeniya in 2 hours. In such a journey, a vehicle 
cannot maintain the same speed throughout the whole journey.  However we could divide the total distance of 100 km by the total time duration of 2 hours as done above to calculate the average speed, which is 50 kilometers per hour.
2.3 Velocity
Because we calculate the speed in terms of distance, we do not consider the direction 
when we calculate the speed. Therefore, it must be clear to you by now, that the speed is a scalar quantity.  The velocity however, is defined as the rate of change of the displacement.  Therefore, it is a vector quantity  that has both a magnitude and 
a direction.
The velocity of an object can be obtained by dividing its displacement by time.
Velocity = displacement 
   time
    
total distance travelled
total time duration
30 31We learnt earlier that sometimes, bodies could move with uniform speeds while at 
other times they could move with non-uniform speeds.  In a similar manner, the velocity of a body too can be uniform during certain time intervals while it can be non-uniform at other intervals. 
The table below shows the displacement of a body along a specific direction, at the 
end of each 1 s time interval, as measured from the starting point.
     
Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4
Displacement s (m) 0 3 5 9 12
Since the increase in the displacement of the body during each second is 3 m, the 
motion has taken place at a constant or uniform velocity .
When a body is moving at a constant velocity, neither the  magnitude nor the direction of its velocity changes with time.
If a body moves along a straight line at a constant velocity of 6 m s
-1, then the 
change in the displacement during each 1 s interval is 6 m.  The direction of the 
motion too remains constant.  If the body moves at this constant velocity for 5 s, 
then its displacement after 5 s = 6 m s-1× 5 s = 30 m.  
That is, for a body moving at a constant velocity, the displacement after a certain 
time interval can be obtained by multiplying the velocity by the relevant time interval.
  Displacement = velocity × time
The following table shows the displacement of another object moving on a straight 
line, as measured during each 1 s time interval.  
Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4
Displacement s (m) 0 4 7 9 12
The displacement of this object is 4 m in the first second, 3 m in the second  second, 
and 2m in the third second etc. As the displacement is not the same in every second, 
the velocity of the object is not uniform. In such occasions we can calculate themean velocity.

  That is, the velocity is 4 m s-1 in the opposite direction.
2.4 Acceleration
In everyday life we mostly encounter, objects that move with non-uniform velocities.  
Vehicles moving in roadways have to increase or decrease their velocities frequently.  Sometimes they have to change their direction.  The result of all these changes is the change of velocity.
The following table shows the manner in which  the velocity of a body that travelled 
along a straight line var ied with time.
        Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Velocity v (m s-1) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12
According to the above data, the velocity of the body has changed from 0 m s-1 to 
12 m s-1 during a 6 s period
Change in the 
velocity during 6 s velocity at the 
end of 6 sinitial
velocity
When we divide the above velocity change (12 m s-1) by the time duration for this 
change (6 s), we get the rate of change of the velocity.
The rate of change of the velocity is known as the acceleration .  That is, the change 
in velocity per unit time is the acceleration.
32 33We already know that the unit of the velocity is m s-1.  Since the acceleration is the 
velocity change in a second, the acceleration has the unit ms-2(    ).
Therefore we can calculate the acceleration of the above object in the following 
manner.
   Acceleration  = 
=
=final velocity - intial velocity
time
( 12 - 0 ) m s-1
6 s
2 m s-2
When a body has an acceleration of 2 m s-2, it means that its velocity changes by 
2 m s-1 during each second.  If the acceleration has a positive value, it implies that 
the velocity is increasing. A negative acceleration means a decrease in the velocity.
Suppose that a body moving in a straight line had an initial velocity of 12 m s-1, 
which later varied with time as shown in the following table.
Time t (s) 0 1 2 3 4
Velocity v (m s-1) 12 9 6 3 0
Here, the velocity has decreased.  The acceleration of this body can be calculated 
in the following manner.
        Acceleration =    change of velocity
 time
     =    ( 0 - 12 ) m s-1
4 s          =    -3 m s-2
Here, we have obtained a negative value for the acceleration.  It means that the 
velocity has decreased by 3 m s-1 each second.
If the velocity is decreasing, the acceleration takes a negative value. A negativeacceleration is known as a deceleration .  
If a body has an acceleration of -3 m s
-2, it means that the body has a deceleration 
of 3 m s-2.sms-1

34 35If the velocity of a body either increases or decreases by the same amount every 
second, then that body is said to have a uniform acceleration or deceleration.
In order to find the displacement of a body moving at a uniform acceleration, we 
should find the mean velocity of the body and multiply it by the corresponding time.
   Displacement = mean velocity × time
Example 1
A body that starts from rest, is subjected to a uniform acceleration for 6 s after 
which, it acquires a velocity of 12 m s-1.  What is the displacement of the body 
during this time interval?
Since the acceleration is uniform, we can find the mean velocity by dividing the 
sum of the initial and final velocities by two.
Displacement of the body  =     mean velocity × time
     =     ( 0 + 12 )
2 m s-1  ×  6 s
     =     36 m
Example 2
A body starting from rest, accelerates for 4 s and acquires a velocity of 12 m s-1.  
Thereafter it moves at a constant velocity of 12 m s-1 for 4 s and ultimately comes 
to rest after decelerating for 2 s.  
(i) Calculate the acceleration during the first 4 s.
(ii) Find the deceleration during the last 2 s.
(iii) What is the displacement of the body during the 10 s?Mean velocity = initial velocity + final velocity  
                     time
34 35Answers
 (i)   Acceleration during the first 4 s  =   (12-0) m s-1
4 s
  = 3 m s-2
(ii)    Acceleration during the  last 2 s   =  (0-12)m s-1
2 s   
  = - 6 m s-2
       Deceleration = 6 m s-2
(iii) Displacement during the first 4 s  = mean velocity × time                          
  =  ×  4 s( 0+12 ) m s-1
2
  =  24 m
     Displacement during the next 4 s = uniform velocity × time
   = 12 × 4 
  =  48 m
   
        Displacement during last 2 s   = mean velocity × time
  =  ×  2 s( 12 + 0 ) m s-1
2    
   
  =  12 m
  Total displacement during the 10 s   = 24 m +48 m +12 m
  = 84 m
That is, the final position of the object after 10 s is 84 m away on a straight line from 
the starting point.
36 37Exercise 2.2
1. If the velocity of an object increased uniformly from 0 to 12 m s-1 during 
6 s, find the acceleration of the object. 
2. If the velocity of an object decreased uniformly from 16 m s-1 to 4 m s-1 
during 4 s, calculate the deceleration of the object. 
3. Starting from rest, if an object travelled with an acceleration of 0.5 m s-2, 
for 10 s  find the velocity of the object at the end of 10 s period.
4.  The velocity of an object moving on a straight line was 2 m s-1 at a certain 
instant. Its velocity changed to 6 m s-1, after accelerating for 4 s.  Find the 
acceleration during the 4 s period.
2. 5 Displacement-time graphs
Graphs that illustrate how the displacement of a body varies with time are known 
as displacement - time graphs.  These graphs are plotted by marking the time on the x-axis and the displacement on the y-axis.
The following table shows the variation of the displacement of a body with time.

Figure 2.9 - A displacement - time graph
36 37Since the velocity is uniform in this case, we get a straight line for the graph. For a 
body with the non - uniform velocity, we get a curve for the graph. The velocity can be obtained by determining the gradient of the graph.
The gradient of a straight line can be calculated by dividing the difference between 
the y-coordinates of any two points on that line by the difference between the 
corresponding x-coordinates of the two points. However, if two distant points are 
chosen to find the gradient the result will be more accurate.
Since the x-axis represents time, the difference between the x-coordinates of two 
points is a time interval.  The corresponding difference between the  y-coordinates 
is the displacement of the body during that time interval. What we get when the displacement is divided by time is a velocity.

Therefore, the velocity can be calculated by choosing two fairly distant points A

Therefore, the velocity of the motion represented by the above graph is 3 m s-1.
2.6 Velocity-time graphs
In order to represent the variation of velocity with time, velocity-time graphs are 
used.  In velocity-time graphs, the time is plotted on the x-axis while the velocity is 
plotted on the y-axis.
The table below gives  the variation of velocity with time for the motion of an object.=

Figure 2.10 - A velocity - time graph
This graph is a straight line, because the increase in the velocity during each 1 s 
interval is the same.  This represents a motion with a unifor m (constant) acceleration.
As mentioned before, the gradient of the straight line can be obtained by dividing the difference between t he y-coordinates of any two points on the graph by the 
difference between the corresponding x-coordinates.
In this graph also, the x-axis represents time.  Therefore, the difference between x
coordinates gives a time interval.  The corresponding difference in the y coordinates 
gives the velocity difference during this time interval.  Velocity difference divided 
by time gives an acceleration.

           Acceleration    =  (18 - 0) m s-1
6 s
                   =  3 m s-2
Figure 2.11 shows the velocity - time graph for the motion of a body moving at a 
constant velocity of 6 m s-1.  Since the velocity remains the same in a motion taking 
place with a constant velocity, this graph is a straight line parallel to the x-axis.
Since the velocity of the motion described by the above graph is 6 m s-1, you can 
calculate the displacement as shown below, using the formula you learnt in section 
2.3.
          Velocity  =   timet displcemen

40 41As shown in Figure 2.11 , the area under the straight line is 6 × 8 = 48 m.  This area 
is calculated by multiplying the length along the x-axis (time) by the length along the y-axis (velocity).
That is, the displacement is equal to the area under the velocity - time graph.
Let us now consider how we could find the displacement of a body moving at a uniform acceleration using its velocity - time graph.
A body starting from rest, acquires a velocity of 12 m s
-1 after moving at a constant 
acceleration for 4 s.  A velocity - time graph plotted for this motion is shown in 
Figure 2.12.

Figure 2.12 - A velocity - time graph of a body moving at a

According what we learnt in section 2.4, the displacement of a body moving with a 
uniform acceleration can be found using the formula,
Displacement = mean velocity × time
Therefore, for the motion shown in Figure 2.12,
            
  Displacement   =  12 m s-1

Again see how this area was calculated.
   12   ×   4       2
 12/2 is the mean velocity. Displacement = mean velocity × time
That is, the displacement of a body moving at a uniform acceleration is 
equal to the magnitude of the area under the velocity-time graph.
This graphical method provides you with another way of finding the displacement 
of an object.
Example 
A body with an initial velocity of 8 m s-1 moves under a constant deceleration, and 
comes to rest after 4 s.  Plot the velocity - time graph for this motion and find the 
displacement during the 4 s.

The velocity - time graph is shown in the figure. The displacement is equal to the area of the shaded region. 
  Displacement of the body  =  8  ×  4          2

42 43• Now consider the following problem.  
An object starting from rest, acquires a velocity of 15 m s-1 after moving for 6 s 
under a uniform acceleration.  Then the object moves with that velocity for 6 s and 
comes to rest after decelerating for 3 s.

• During the periods of heavy traffic, vehicles have to reduce the speed frequently. When the vehicles begin to move again, the engine has to produce extra power.  This process causes an energy loss.  Such losses can be minimized  by travelling during hours of low traffic whenever possible.
2.7 Gravitational acceleration
By experience we know that when a  body falls, its velocity increases gradually. 
That is, the body accelerates.  In order to give rise to an acceleration, a force must 
act on the body. The force that acts on a falling body is the gravitational force exerted by the earth. The acceleration caused by the earth’s gravitational attraction is known as the gravitational acceleration.  Its symbol is g.
The average value for the gravitational acceleration at sea level is about 9.8 m s
-2. 
This means that the velocity of a free falling body increases by 9.8 m s-1 every
second.
44 45When a body is moving vertically upwards, the velocity decreases by 9.8 m s-1
every second.  Therefore, the gravitational acceleration of a body moving vertically 
upwards is, -9.8 m s-2.
Suppose that a body falling vertically down after starting from rest takes 4 s to reach the ground.  Its velocity change during each second can be stated as follows.
 Initial velocity  = 0
Velocity at the end of 1 s  = 9.8 m s
-1
Velocity at the end of 2 s  = 19.6 m s-1
Velocity at the end of 3 s  = 29.4 m s-1
Since it took 4 s to fall to the ground, the velocity upon reaching the ground, that   
is the velocity at the end of 4 s = 39.2 m s-1
Height that the body fell during 4 s  = mean velocity × time
        
  
The velocity - time graph for the above motion is shown in Figure 2.13.

Let us next plot a velocity - time  graph for a body reaching the maximum height 
after being initially projected vertically upwards with a velocity of 20 m s-1  ( Take 
g = 10 m s-2 for convenience of the calculations)

Atoms are the building units of matter. The atom is composed of subatomic particles. 
Among them, protons, electrons and neutrons are the main subatomic particles.
The electron is a negatively charged particle. Proton has a positive charge while 
neutrons have no charge. With the identification that particles called electrons, protons and neutrons constitute matter, and as a result of the effort taken to describe how those particles are organized in matter, the atomic model was introduced.  According to the nuclear model put forward by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, there is a very small area called nucleus at the centre of the atom.If the atom is a football ground, nucleus is a small volume, even smaller than a chickpea at its centre. From this example, it is clear that the nucleus of an atom is  03 Chemistry
Structure of Matter
   For free distribution 52           For free distribution 53
Structure of Matter Chemistry
very small relative to an atom. Protons and neutrons are accumulated in the nucleus. 
The nucleus is positively charged.
Electrons revole around the nucleus. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to 
the number of protons. However the protons and electrons are oppositely charged and therefore, the atom is electrically neutral.
3.1 The Planetary Model of the Atom
The planetary model of the atom was introduced by Ernest Rutherford.Electrons move around the nucleus  in which the positive charge of the atom is concentrated. This is similar to the solar system where the planets revolve around the sun (Fig. 3.1).
Though electrons are attracted by the 
positive charge of the nucleus, they do not fall on the nucleus. This is because electrons revolve very fast around the nucleus. Niels Bohr who further elaborated the Rutherford's model stated that the electrons move in definite paths or shells around the positively charged nucleus.The shells in which the electrons revole around  the nucleus are assigned either numbers 1, 2, 3, 4...... or letters K, L, M, N...... respectively starting from the nearest to the nucleus. 
The shells are also known as energy levels. Each energy level has a specific energy. 
When moving away from the nucleus this energy increases. Nevertheless, the difference between the energy levels decreases (Fig 3.2). In an atom, there is a maximum number of electrons in any energy level.Table 3.1 gives the total number of electrons in the first four energy levels nearest to the nucleus. There is a specified energy for each energy level.

Atomic number of the element = number of protons in an atom of the elementFor example, there are 11 protons in the nucleus of a sodium atom. Thus, the atomic 
number of sodium is 11.The number of protons in every atom of the same element is equal. The number of protons in different elements is different. Therefore, the atomic numbers of two atoms of different elements will never be the same. Hence, 
the atomic number of an element is a unique characteristic of that element.For instance, if the atomic number of an element is 6, it means that the element is carbon. In no other element, the atomic number is equal to 6. The atomic number of an element is symbolised by Z. In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in it. So, it implies that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in an atom of that element.
However, when chemical reactions take place, electrons may be either lost from or 
gained by atoms. Such charged atoms are called ions. The number of electrons in an ion may be less or more than the number of protons. But, since the number of protons in an ion formed by a particular atom does not change, its atomic number remains unchanged.
yMass number
Of the fundermental subatomic particles called protons, neutrons and electrons contained in an atom, electrons are very light. The mass of protons and neutrons is nearly equal.Approximately, the mass of an electron is 1/1840 the mass of a proton. So in comparison to the mass of protons and neutrons in an atom, the mass

of electrons is negligibly small. Therefore, the mass of an atom depends only on the 
mass of protons and neutrons. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons 
in the nucleus of an atom is called the mass number.
\  mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons
Symbol A signifies the mass number of an element.
 yAtomic number of sodium is 11.
 yHence, a sodium atom contains 11 protons. 
 yIf it contains 12 neutrons,the mass number of the sodium atom = 11+12=23.
There is a standard way of writing the atomic number and mass number of an 
element. On the left hand side of the symbol of the relevant element, the atomic number is written at the bottom and the mass number at the top. 
 Example (  The mass number of sodium (Na) is 23.
     Its atomic number is 11.
    A    23     
      X                    Na    
    Z    11  
 A - mass number   atomic number - 11    
 Z - atomic number   mass number  - 23
The difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons in the atom.
3.2 Electronic Configuration
The maximum number of electrons that can be accomodated in the respective energy levels according to the atomic model accepted at present was discussed earlier. Representing  how electrons are filled in the respective energy levels 
from the one  nearest to the nucleus of an atom and outwards is called electronic configuration. Let's look at an example. The atomic number of sodium 
is 11. Therefore, a sodium atom has 11 protons and 11 electrons. Those eleven electrons in the sodium atom are distributed as 2 electrons in the first energy level, 8 electrons in the second energy level and 1 electron in the third energy level. Hence the electronic configuration of sodium can be written as follows.   
Na - 2, 8, 1

3.3  Modern Periodic Table
As at present, more than 115 elements have been discovered. Studying their 
properties individually is a very tedious task. Scientists in various parts of the world collect information about elements and their compounds continuously. This host of information is so large and diverse that no one is able to memorise all the facts about them. Therefore different scientists have attempted to classify elements in various ways.The periodic classification is the greatest result of this attempt. A Periodic Table for classifying elements was first introduced by Dmitri Mendeleeff ,a Russian 
scientist.
The modern Periodic Table (Fig. 3.3) is based on the atomic number and the 
electronic configuration. The periodic law states that the properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic number. This means that when the elements are arranged in the ascending order of their atomic numbers, elements with similar properties recur at regular intervals of elements.

(shells) carrying electrons in an atom of that element.
Period 1   - Only the first energy level carries electrons Period 2  - Only the first and second energy levels carry electrons Period 3  - Only the first, second, and third energy levels carry electrons Period 4   - Only the first, second, third and fourth energy levels carry electrons

outermost energy level. These are known as valence electrons. As per the above table, it is seen that the properties of lithium which has only one valence electron is similar to that of sodium.

3.4 Isotopes
Among the atoms of the same element too, there may be atoms with different number 
of neutrons. But their atomic number, that is the number of protons, is equal. That means, there may be atoms with different mass numbers in the same element. The 
atoms with different mass numbers in the same element are known as isotopes of that element.

3.5 Patterns Seen in the Periodic Table
In the Periodic Table it can be seen that the physical and chemical properties of 
the elements change according to a systematic pattern across a Period from left to right and from top to bottom of a Group. To study those patterns, let's consider the following properties of the elements.
 y First ionisation energy
 y Electronegativity
 yFirst ionisation energy
In accordance with the nuclear model of the atom, its electrons orbit the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted by the positively charged nucleus, so to remove an electron from an atom energy must be supplied to overcome that attraction. When an electron is removed from an atom, it becomes a positive ion.35

This energy is a comparatively small value for an atom. Therefore, this value is   given 
for 6.022 x 1023 atoms or a mole of atoms. Fig. 3.7. indicates the values for one mole 
of atoms of respective elements. Accordingly, the first ionisation energy of sodium is 495 kJ mol-1 .              
In a given Period, the Group I elements have the minimum first ionisation energy. Also in every Period, Group VIII elements have the maximum ionisation energy .From left to right in a Period, the first ionisation energy varies in a regular manner. This is confirmed when the variation of ionisation energies in the second and third periods are 
examined using the graph (Fig 3.8).

Fig. 3.8 - The graph of ionisation energy variation against atomic number for first 20 elementsThe first ionisation energy of an 
element is the minimum energy that should be supplied to an atom in the gaseous state to remove an electron to form a unipositive gaseous ion. The formation of a unipositive gaseous ion by removing an electron from an atom in the gaseous state can be represented by a chemical equation as follows.

Chemistry Structure of Matter
Draw a graph of the first ionisation energy values of elements 
of atomic numbers 1 - 20 given in the Fig. 3.7, against the atomic number. Use a graph paper for this assignment. Describe how the first ionisation energy varies across a Period from left to right and from top 
to bottom in a Group using your graph.Assignment - 3.2 
It is seen that in Group I elements, values of the first ionisation energy decrease from top to bottom of the Group. You can understand this by examining the values of the other groups also. Therefore, it can be concluded that, from top to bottom of a Group, the ionisation energy decreases. Descending a group, the number of energy levels in an atom increases.Therefore, the attraction exerted by the nucleus on the electrons in the outer energy level becomes less making the removal of electrons easier.
 y   Electronegativity
Electronegativity means the ability of an atom of an element to attract the electrons of a bond towards itself when it is bonded to an atom of another element. The attraction of an atom of higher electronegativity towards electrons is greater than that of lower electronegativity. More about electronegativity will be discussed under the unit on chemical bonds.
As  per the Pauling scale, fluorine is considered the element of highest 
electronegativity. There are several scales to quantify the electronegativity of which the Pauling scale has been adopted here. Pauling scale does not assign electronegativity values to noble gases (Noble gases show less tendency to form chemical bonds).
Study the electronegativity values and the graph that illustrates the variation of 
electronegativity values well. It can be seen that the electronegativity increases from left to right across a Period. It is also seen that, down a Group, electronegativity decreases.

Chemical properties of sodium metal  
 ySodium shows a high reactivity towards oxygen. It reacts rapidly with 
oxygen in air to form the oxide of the metal.
 ySodium metal vigourously reacts with cold water forming sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
 yIt reacts violently with dilute acids and forms salt and hydrogen gas (Since this is extremely dangerous you shouldn't attempt this. )

 yMagnesium does not react with cold water but reacts with hot water. As a   
    result, it forms magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. When the metal is 
strongly heated in steam, magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas  are formed.
 yMagnesium rapidly reacts with dilute acids and forms the corresponding   magnesium salt and hydrogen gas.
Uses of magnesium

 yNon - metals
Generally, non – metals have properties opposite to those of metals. There are non 
– metals which occur as native elements as well as compounds of other elements. Some non – metals occur in solid state while some others exist in liquid and gaseous states. At room temperature carbon, sulphur, phosphorus and iodine exist in the solid state. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature. Chlorine, fluorine, nitrogen and oxygen are some non - metals occurring in the gaseous state. Non - metals do not have a metallic lustre. They cannot be hammered into sheets or drawn into wires. Many non – metals are brittle and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. However graphite, a non - metal is a conductor of electricity. Non-metals have a relatively low density but the density of diamond is high. 
Chemical Properties of Non – metals
 yNon - metals form negative ions (anions).
 yMany oxides formed by non – metals with oxygen are acidic. Mostly these 
exist in the gaseous state. They easily dissolve in water and form acids.
 ySome Non – metallic Elements 
Nitrogen
Nitrogen exists as a free and diatomic gas in the atmosphere. About 78.1% by 
volume in the atmosphere is nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is also present as a component in animal and plant proteins. Nitrogen also exists as a constituent element in soil air, in organic substances such as humus and in nitrates, nitrites and ammonium 
compounds. 
Physical properties of nitrogen
 yIt is colourless and odourless.
 yIt is lighter than air and is slightly soluble in water.
Chemical properties of nitrogen
 yNitrogen is a non - supporter of combustion.
 yIt is a gas of very low reactivity. Nevertheless, at high temperatures, nitrogen 
gas reacts with non metals such as oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and silicon as well as with metallic elements such as magnesium and aluminium. 
 yWhen sent through a strong electric arc, nitrogen combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to form unstable nitric oxide gas. The nitric oxide gas so formed reacts further with oxygen in air to form an acidic gas, nitrogen dioxide. During lightning, this process occurs naturally.

Physical properties of sulphur
 yIt is a poor conductor of electricity. 
 y   Sulphur is insoluble in water. It is slightly soluble in organic solvents and     
highly soluble in carbon disulphide. Sulphur is an element that exists in different forms in nature. Those forms are referred to as allotropes. 
Sulphur occurs in crystalline form as a yellow brittle solid (Fig. 3.14) and in amorphous form as a white powder. In nature, it is found both as a native element as well as compounds like sulphates and sulphides. It is a constituent element in some amino acids found in the bodies of living beings.

Physical properties of carbon 
Physical properties of carbon differ according to the allotropic form of carbon. 
Except diamond,  the other forms of carbon are black in colour and exit in the solid state. Their density is relatively low. But diamond is the form with highest density. Diamond is much valued because of its high refractive index and hardness. Diamond is a poor conductor of electricity. But, graphite is a good conductor of electricity. Charcoal has the ability to absorb gases.
Chemical properties of carbonCarbon is an element of low reactivity. It combines with oxygen at very high 
temperatures but does not react with substances like acids, bases and chlorine. Amorphous forms like charcoal react chemically.Carbon is a non – metal element occurring in abundance. It occurs as carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere, animal and plant tissues, all organic compounds, coal, petroleum products and other hydrocarbons containing carbon. It is an element showing allotropy. Carbon has crystalline forms as well as amorphous forms. In crystalline forms, atoms are orderly arranged but in amorphous forms there is no such arrangment.

3.7 Chemical Formulae  
 yValency
The combining ability of an atom of an element is known as the valency. This is measured relative to hydrogen. Accordingly, the valency of an element is either the number of hydrogen atoms which can combine with or can be replaced by an atom of that element. The electrons present in the outermost energy level of an atom of an element are called valence electrons. Some elements can have several valencies. The number of valence electrons in an atom of an element is generally equal to its highest valency.
The valency of an element is equal to the number of electrons lost from or gained 
by an atom of that element or the number of pairs of electrons shared between the atoms during chemical combination.
We know that chemical symbols are used to identify elements easily.
 Carbon   C   Calcium  Ca
 Potassium  K   Sulphur  S
Similarly, chemical symbols are also used to signify chemical compounds with 
ease. For instance, H
2O is used to represent water, a compound consisting of two 
   For free distribution 74           For free distribution 75
Structure of Matter Chemistry
hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. This is called the chemical formula of water.
If there is a number at the bottom of the symbol of an element in a chemical 
formula, it indicates the number of atoms of that element present in a molecule of the compound. If there is no such number, only one atom of that element is present in a molecule of that compound.
For example, chemical formula of glucose is 
C6 H12O6. This means that a glucose 
molecule comprises 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atom and 6 oxygen atoms.There are instances where the chemical formula does not represent a molecule. 
Table salt, known as sodium chloride is such a compound. Solid sodium chloride does not contain discrete molecules.
It is an ionic lattice  composed of alternately arranged Na
+ and Cl- ions. In the lattice 
Na+ and Cl- ions are present in the ratio of 1:1, so its formula is written as NaCl.
 yWriting Formulae Using Valency 
Compounds are formed by the attachment of atoms or ions of elements by chemical 
bonds. Therefore, to write the formula of a compound, their combining powers or valencies should be known. The formula is written so that the respective combining powers are balanced.
 yThe valency of hydrogen is 1.
 yThe valency of oxygen is 2.
 ySo, two hydrogen atoms can combine with one oxygen atom. 
 yThis is written as H
2O.
 yThe valency of nitrogen is 3.
 yHence, three hydrogen atoms can combine with one nitrogen atom. 
 yThis is written as NH3.
 yThe valency of carbon is 4. So, four hydrogen atoms can combine with one 
carbon atom.
 yThis is written as CH4.

So, what is done in writing the chemical formula of a compound is connecting the atoms so that their combining powers become equal. This is done by exchanging the valencies of the two elements and writing them at the bottom end on the right hand side of the respective symbols.

4.1 Nature of force and its effects
You have studied about force in your previous classes.  When we push something, we 
apply a force. When we pull something also, we apply a force. Lifting, compressing 
are also results of applying forces.
What should we do to move a body which is at rest?  We have to apply a force in 
the direction we need to move the body.  However, does it start to move as soon as we apply the force?     
Figure 4.1 - Pushing a tableTry to push a table as shown in Figure 
4.1.  If it does not move, increase the force.  When you keep increasing the force, at some point, it will begin to move. 
Figure 4.2 - Pushing a busIf you try to move a bus yourself, in the 
same manner that you tried to move the 
table, the bus would not move.  But if  you push it with the help of a group of people as shown in Figure 4.2, it would move.  That is, if we apply a force sufficient to overcome a force that tends to oppose the motion of an object, then it would begin to move. The force that opposes the motion of the object is a resistive force called friction.  If the force that we apply is small, it would balance with the resistive force. Since the net force acting on the object at such an instance is zero, the object would not move.  If we apply a sufficiently large force, the resistive force would not be able to balance it, and then there would be anunbalanced force acting on the object, which could set the object in motion.  
84 85 For free distribution For free distributionIf the above mentioned table was on a very smooth surface, such as ice, even a very 
small force would be sufficient to start the motion. That is because, when there is no resistive force, the whole force that we apply becomes an unbalanced force and contributes to the motion of the table. When ever an unbalanced force acts on an object at rest, the object starts to move.  
             
Figure 4.3 - A cart pulled by 
a bullFigure 4.3 shows a cart loaded with goods being pulled by a bull.  If someone applies 
a force from behind,  in the direction that the cart is moving, then the cart would move faster.  If a force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, the cart would slow down. This shows that the result of applying a force depends on the direction of the force.
This means that the force has both a 
magnitude and a direction.  Since there is a magnitude as well as a direction, the force is a vector. The direction of a force acting on some point can be indicated by a  straight line drawn from that point. This line is called the line of action of the force.
What we experience about force and motion has been studied in depth by the famous 
scientist, Sir Isaac Newton.  He has formulated three laws of motion based on his studies.  Let us now investigate each of these laws.
Newton’s first law
Until an unbalanced force is applied on it, bodies at rest remain stationary and bodies in motion continue to move at uniform velocities.
From day to day experience we know that bodies at rest do not start moving without external forces acting on them.  However, we often observe that moving bodies come to rest without an external force exerted on them by us.  Let us consider the following example in order to understand this.
86 87 For free distribution For free distribution       
Figure 4.4 - Striking a carom disc
Consider the case of striking on 
the carom disc on a carom board with your fingernail as shown in Figure 4.4.  Then the disc would move a short distance and come to rest. If we apply some talcum powder on the carom board to make the surface smoother and then repeat the above action by striking on the disc with roughly the same force as before, the disc would move a much longer 
distance before coming to rest.
The action of the talcum powder on the board is to reduce the resistive forces 
exerted on the disc by the carom board.  The resistive force that opposes the motion of an object on a surface, is called friction.  If by some means we could make the frictional force equal to zero, the disc would move without stopping.
Let us consider another example that we experience in daily life, connected to this 
law.  Suppose a passenger is standing on a moving bus without holding any thing for support.  If the bus suddenly stops by applying brakes, the passenger would fall towards the forward direction.  What is the reason for this?
Since his feet were in contact with the floor board of the bus, the floor board exerts 
a resistive force on the feet and brings the feet (which too had the speed of the bus)to rest.  Since no such force is exerted on the upper parts of his body, their velocity, carries him forward.  He falls in the forward direction because of this.
Now suppose that the above passenger is in a bus at rest.  If the bus starts to move 
without his knowledge, the passenger would now fall in the backward direction.  As the bus starts, it would exert a force on the feet of the passenger giving the lower part of his body a velocity.  The upper part of his body however does not have this velocity and remains at rest, resulting in his falling back.
Seat belts must be worn when riding in a vehicle to prevent the passenger from 
falling forward upon applying brakes.  As the seat belt exerts a force on the upper part of his body as well, the whole body remains at the velocity of the vehicle even when brakes are applied. if no belts are worn the upper part of the body has some velocity and tends  to go forward.

Figure 4.5 –  Seat belt privents the driver being thrown forward when breaks are applied.
Newton’s second law
The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the unbalanced force 
acting on it, while it is inversely proportional to its mass.
Here, ''the acceleration is directly proportional to the unbalanced force'' means that when the magnitude of the unbalanced force is increased or decreased by a certain ratio then the acceleration also increases or decreases by the same ratio. 
This is symbolically written as a  ∝  F.  
Similarly "the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass" means that if the 
mass is increased  by a certain ratio, then the acceleration decreases by the same ratio, and if the mass is decreased by a certain ratio, then the acceleration increases by the same ratio.
This statement is symbolically written as, a   ∝  1
m
 .
Therefore Newton’s second law can be written as
 a   ∝  F and
          a  ∝ 1
m
               or, a   ∝ F
m
Therefore we have,    F / m
a = constantF / m
F / m 
a
88 89 For free distribution For free distributionThe unit of force is defined in such a way that the above constant is equal to one.
That is, if the unit of force is defined in such a way that the force required to produce a unit acceleration (1 m s
-2) in a body of unit mass (1 kg) is equal to 1 
Newton (1 N), Then the value of the left hand side of the above equation becomes 1, That means  when
    F / m
a= 1
then the constant will also become 1. Therefore, Newton's second law can be written 
as     F = ma
A force is acting on an object, gives rise to an acceleration.
Let us consider the following experiment in order to verify Newton’s second law.
            Figure 4.6 - Demonstrating that the acceleration of a trolley increases with force 
●  Place a trolley on a horizontal surface, attach a rubber band to the trolley and 
hold the trolley with one hand.
●  Hold the free end of the rubber band with the other hand as shown in Figure 4.6 
and pull it  until it is extended  to the other end of the trolley.
● Next, release the trolley and move your hand along with the trolley, without 
changing the extension of the rubber band.  You will notice that the trolley moves with an acceleration.
●  Attach another rubber band similar to the first one to the trolley and stretch 
both to the other end of the trolley as before and repeat the experiment.  As the force on the trolley is now twice the force in the previous step, you will be able to observe that the trolley moves with a larger acceleration than before.
●  Repeat the experiment with three rubber bands and observe that the acceleration is even larger than that in the second time.  Since there are three rubber bands, the force exerted on the trolley is three times as large as in the first time.
● Accordingly, it can be observed that the acceleration of the trolley increases as the force exerted on it is increased.F / m

88 89 For free distribution For free distribution●  Now place a mass on the trolley and repeat the experiment with one rubber band 
and observe the motion of the trolley.  You will observe that the acceleration has 
decreased.
● Then repeat the experiment with another mass placed on the trolley and you will 
notice that the acceleration decreases further.
From this it will be clear that the acceleration decreases with increasing mass if the force is constant.
  a  = F
m
It is clear from the above equation that for a constant force, the acceleration increases 
if the mass is decreased and the acceleration decreases if the mass is increased.
Example 1
What is the force required to give an acceleration of 2 m s-2 to a 5 kg mass?
   F = ma
        = 5 kg × 2 m s-2
            = 10 N 
              (1 kg m s-2 = 1 N)

Newton’s third law
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Here, an action means a force exerted by an object on another object.  Then the 
reaction is a force exerted on the first object, by the second object.
Expulsion of air from an inflated balloon is a practical situation where this law 
can be applied.  Hold a balloon filled with air, with its opening turned downwards.  
90 91 For free distribution For free distributionLoosen the hold on the opening and release the balloon as shown in Figure 4.7.  
You will notice that the balloon would initially move upwards rapidly and later fall down.  Air leaves the balloon as its rubber walls push the air molecules downwards.  The balloon moves upward due to the reaction force exerted on the rubber walls by the air molecules moving out.

A balloon moving due to air leaving the balloon can also be illustrated as shown in Figure 4.8.  Attach a straw to an air filled balloon as shown in Figure 4.8, using cellotape.  Insert a metal wire through the straw and fix it horizontally from the two ends. Allow the air in the balloon to leave by removing the thread that closes the opening of the balloon.
You will be able to observe the balloon moving on the metal wire in the direction 
opposite to that of the air leaving the balloon.

two planks of wood on a few glass balls. Let two children sit on the two planks.  If they push each other with their palms as shown, it would be possible to observe them moving in opposite directions.
Figure 4.9 - Two children being pushed in opposite directions when pushing 
each other with their palms.
A few other instances where Newton’s third law is applied are mentioned below.
When rowing a boat (Figure 4.10), water is pushed in the backward direction using 
the oars.  That is, a force is applied on water by the oars.  Then the boat moves forward due to the reaction force applied on the oars by water.
      
Figure 4.10 – Force applied on the water by the oars and the reaction force acting on the boat. 
In swimming (Figure 4.11), the swimmer exerts a force on water in the backward 
direction. Then water exerts the reaction force on the swimmer's body in the forward direction. Because of this, the swimmer moves forward. The action in this case is the backward force applied by the hands. The reaction is the forward thrust exerted by water.

exerted on the hands by water.          
4.2 Momentum
The momentum of a moving body is a measure of how difficult it is to stop the 
motion of that body.
It would be an easy task to catch a pen or pencil thrown to you by a friend.  If 
however, somebody throws a putt or some other heavy object towards you, it would not be so easy to catch it. If the same object is handed over to you without throwing then it would not be difficult to take it to your hand.
The reason for the difficulty in catching such an object is not only its large mass 
but also the speed with which it is moving.  A bullet fired from a gun has very small mass.  But once it is fired, we cannot even think of catching it.
Therefore, we can conclude that the level of difficulty in stopping a moving body 
depends on two factors; mass and velocity.
In physics, the momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of the mass (m) 
of the object and its velocity ( v).
  
Momentum  = mass  × velocity
 p =   m  ×  v
The unit of mass is kg. The unit of velocity is m s-1.  Therefore, 
the unit of momentum is kg m s-1.
Since the velocity is a vector, the momentum is also a vector.
When a motor vehicle is moving fast, it possesses a large momentum.  When it 
reduces its velocity, the momentum decreases.  When it speeds up, the momentum increases.
94 95 For free distribution For free distributionExample 1
What is the momentum of a body of mass 2000 kg moving at a velocity of 20 m s-1?
    Momentum  = m × v
     = 2000 kg × 20 m s-1 
      = 40000 kg m s-1
Example 2
A bullet of mass 10 g fired by a gun moves at a velocity of 400 m s-1. Find its 
momentum.
In this problem, when we substitute the value of mass to the equation, we must 
convert the mass to kg.
    Momentum  = m × v
     = 10
1000  kg × 400 m s-1
      =  4 kg m s-1
Exercise 4.2
1. The mass of a motor car is 800 kg.  Find its momentum when it is moving at 
a velocity of 5 m s-1.
2. The mass of an object is 600 g.  Find its momentum when it is moving at a 
velocity of 5 m s-1.
3. A certain object has a mass of 200 g. if it moves with a velocity of 4 m s-1 what 
is the momentum of the object ?
4. The momentum of a moving object is 6 kg m s-1.  Find its velocity if it has  a 
mass of 500 g.
5. An object of mass 3 kg is projected upwards.  At the beginning of the motion 
its velocity is 10 m s-1.
    (a)  What was its momentum at the moment when it was projected?
   (b)  What would be the momentum when it reaches the highest point?
94 95 For free distribution For free distribution4.3 Mass and weight
The mass of an object is the amount of matter in it.  The international unit of mass 
is the kg.
The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.  
That is, the force acting on it due to gravitational attraction of the earth.
According to Newton’s second law, the force acting on a body moving at an 
acceleration is given by, 
 F =   m a 
If it is moving under gravity, then its acceleration would be the gravitational acceleration g.  Then, the force exerted on the body is its weight and it is given by,
  Weight = mass × acceleration  =   m g
Because the weight is defined as a force, its international unit is the Newton (N).  
The point of which this force acts is the centre of gravity ot the body. Since the gravitational acceleration near the surface of the earth at sea level is 
9.8 m s
-2, the weight of a body of mass m is 9.8 m. The weight of an object of mass 
1 kg would be 9.8  N.
Attractive force exerted by the earth on a mass of 3 kg (weight) = 3 kg × 9.8 m s-2
       = 29.4 N
When we go up, starting from sea level, the gravitational acceleration gradually 
decreases. Therefore, if we take an object to the top of a mountain, the weight of the object becomes less, while the mass remains constant. On the moon, the gravitational acceleration is about 1/6 of that on the earth. Therefore, the weight of an object on the moon is about 1/6 of the weight of that object on the earth.

Summary
² According to Newton’s first law, until an unbalanced force acts on it, a 
stationary body remains at rest and a moving body continues its motion at a 
uniform velocity.
² Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
² Newton’s third law states that for every action, there is a reaction equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the action.
²   The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted to the center 
of the earth.  It is equal to the force that is required to accelerate it with the gravitational acceleration g.

5.1 Nature of friction
If we place an object such as a pencil on a table and tap on it so that it starts to move  
on the table, we know from experience that its speed would gradually decrease until it ultimately comes to rest.  If we place the same object on a surface smoother than that of the table, the object would move a longer distance on the surface before coming to rest.
An object moving on a surface gradually slows down and comes to rest as described 
above, because the surface exerts a force on the object to oppose its motion. This opposing force is known as a frictional force. Friction always opposes the motion of an obiect.
Let us consider a situation where a table needs to be pushed along a horizontal floor 
as shown in Figure 5.1.
        
Figure 5.1 – Pushing a table
If we try to move the table with a very small force, it might not move.  This is 
because the floor exerts a force on the table which opposes the force that we apply. The two forces have equal magnitudes but opposite directions. Therefore they cancel out.
98 99 For free distribution For free distributionNow suppose that we slightly increase the force that we apply on the table.  If the 
table still does not start to move, it means that the frictional force exerted by the floor has automatically increased in order to balance the force that we applied. The  frictional force is a force which automatically adjusts to balance the force we apply. However, if  we keep on increasing the force on the table, at some instant, the table will begin to move. This happens because the frictional force cannot automatically adjust beyond a certain limit. When the force that we apply exceeds that limit, an unbalanced force that is equal to the difference between the two opposite forces remains. This unbalanced force starts the motion of the table.
The forces that act between the surfaces of two objects  in contact with each 
other, to oppose the relative motion when the objects are moving relative to each other or, to oppose the tendency to move when the objects have a tendency to move relative to each other, are called frictional forces.
Frictional forces exist in the motion of liquids and gasses too, However, in this 
lesson we discuss only the frictional forces that act between solid bodies.
5.2   Static, limiting and dynamic states of frictional forces
Frictional forces can be divided into three categories, depending on the situations 
they act on a body
They are:
1.  The frictional forces that act when there is no relative motion, even though, 
a force is applied on the body.
2.  The frictional forces that act on a body as it just begins to move. This force includes the small additional force that is necessary to give it a velocity.
3.  The frictional forces that act on bodies when they are in relative motion.
In order to investigate differences among the three types of frictional forces 
mentioned above, let us do the following activity.

 A Newton balanceA block of wood 
Table
Figure 5.2 – Finding the maximum frictional force exerted on the object     
    Activity 1
Procedure :
● Fix a small ring to the block of wood and attach the balance to the ring.● Place the block of wood on a horizontal table and pull the block as shown in 
Figure 5.2, with a very small force. You would be able to read the magnitude 
of the applied force from the Newton balance. Initially, the force would be insufficient to move the block.
● Gradually increase the force on the object.  When the force is gradually 
increased, at some point it will just begin to move.  Find the force at the moment it just about to move.
The body begins to move because the table surface is not capable of  further increasing the frictional force in order to balance the force that you exerted.  In other words, the frictional force does not exceed that force.  The maximum frictional force exerted by the surface of the table to oppose the motion is equal to the force necessary to just start the motion.
Whenever the force applied on the body is smaller than this maximum frictional 
force, the surface of the table exerts a frictional force on the body that is equal and opposite to the applied force. This frictional force exerted on the body before the motion starts is called static friction .
100 101 For free distribution For free distributionWhen the applied force is gradually increased, the static friction acting on the body 
also increases with it.  However, the static frictional force can increase only up to a certain maximum value.  When the applied force exceeds this maximum value the frictional force is incapable of increasing further in order to keep the body in equilibrium.  Therefore the body begins to move and acquires a small velocity. This maximum frictional force between the surfaces of two bodies in contact with one another is known as the limiting frictional force between the two bodies.
The frictional force acting on the body after the body starts to move, is known as dynamic friction between the two surfaces.  In other words, dynamic friction  is the frictional force acting on bodies that are in motion.  Dynamic friction is slightly less than the limiting frictional force.
5.3    Factors affecting the limiting frictional force
Frictional forces act between objects that are in contact with one another.  Therefore, let us now investigate how the frictional forces depend on the nature and area of contact surfaces and the reaction forces perpendicular to the contact surfaces (normal reaction). 
Let us first do the following activity in order to investigate how the limiting frictional 
force depends on the nature of the contact surfaces.
Items required : A block of wood weighing 60 N, a Newton balance, several sheets 
    of sand paper of various roughness

102 103 For free distribution For free distributionProcedure :
● Fix the block of wood with the sand paper having the lowest roughness with 
rough side facing out and completely covering the bottom surface.
●   Place the block of wood on the table so that the rough surface of the sand 
paper is in contact with the surface of the table. Next pull the Newton balance 
attached to the block with a very small horizontal force at first and then increasing the force gradually.
●   When the block of wood just begins to move, record the reading of the Newton 
balance. This is the limiting frictional force.  
●  Next use a sand paper which is rougher than the first and fix it again to cover 
the bottom surface of the block, and find the limiting frictional force that is just enough to set the block of wood in motion.
●   Repeat the above procedure using several sand papers of increasing roughness 
and record the limiting frictional force each time.
● Compare the results you obtained.  You will observe that the limiting frictional 
force increases gradually with increasing roughness of the sand paper used to cover the block of wood.
This activity shows that the limiting frictional force depends on the nature of 
the surfaces in contact.
Now let us investigate the dependence of the limiting frictional force on the surface 
area of the contact surfaces through the following activity.
Items required : A block of wood with a weight of 60 N and  different dimensions 
for length, width and height, a Newton balance, several pieces of sand paper of equal roughness.Activity 3
102 103 For free distribution For free distributionProcedure :
● Paste the sand paper on the surfaces of the block of wood which have different 
areas.
● Next place the surface with the largest area in contact with the table top and 
find the force that is just enough to move the block (the limiting frictional 
force) as before.
Figure 5.4 – Investigation of the influence of surface area on friction
● Repeat the above step, placing different surfaces of the block in contact 
with the table as shown in Figure 5.4, to find the limiting frictional force 
corresponding to each surface.
● You will find that the limiting frictional force is the same for all surfaces 
of the block of wood in contact with the table. This shows that the limiting frictional force does not depend  on the surface area.A

between bodies in contact, on the limiting frictional force.
Items required: Three blocks of wood each having a weight of 20 N, a Newton
 balance
Procedure :
● As in the previous experiment, place one block of wood on the table and find 
the force required to just move the block. That is the limiting frictional force.
● Next, place another  block of wood on the first one and find the limiting 
frictional force as before.
● Repeat the above step with the third block placed on the other two and record 
the limiting frictional force.        
Figure 5.5 – Investigation of the influence of nomal reaction on   
                    frictional forceThis experiment can 
also be done by placing 
various other objects on the first block of wood instead of the other blocks of wood.
You will notice that the readings obtained for different weights are not the same and that the limiting frictional force increases with increasing weights.  
That is, when the weight 
(W) is increased, the normal reaction exerted on the weight by the table (perpendicular reaction force R) also increases.Activity 4
104 105 For free distribution For free distributionThat is, weight of the object = perpendicular reaction force. 
This activity shows that the limiting frictional force increases when the normal 
reaction between the two forces increases.
The above activities  show that the limiting frictional force depends on the nature of the contact surfaces and the normal reaction between the surfaces while it does not depend on the area of the contact surfaces.
5.4     Practical applications of friction
Various parts of most of the machines and instruments that we use daily are in 
contact with other parts.  When we operate these machines and instruments, these parts slide on one another, giving rise to frictional forces.  Therefore, when machines are operated, an excessive amount of additional work has to be done against frictional forces, causing a loss of energy, This loss of energy appear as heat, raising the temperature of the object.  If we could reduce frictional forces, then we would be able to minimize the energy loss and the rise in temperature.
Methods of reducing friction
● Reducing the roughness of contact surfaces or polishing them.
● Applying lubricators such as graphite, lubrication oil or grease between the 
contact surfaces.
● Inserting balls that could roll between the contact surfaces.  Such balls can 
prevent the two contact surfaces from sliding on each other.  Ball bearings used 
to connect most of the rotating parts of vehicles and machines to stationary parts such as axles are fabricated in this manner.  A few different types of bearings are shown in Figure 5.6.

Advantages of frictional forces
So far we discussed only some disadvantages of frictional forces and how to minimize 
them.  Sometimes friction is useful to us.  A few such examples are given below.
● We can walk on a surface only because of the frictional force exerted by that 
surface on our feet prevents slipping. If we try to walk on a wet surface or an 
oily surface, we tend to slip and fall, due to lack of friction.
● Grooves are etched on the surface of tire as shown in figure 5.7 in order to 
increase the friction between the tire and the road surface.  If a sufficient amount of friction is not exerted on the tire, the wheels would tend to skid on the road, causing accidents. Sometimes, when a motor vehicle is travelling on mud or 
sand, the wheels tend to rotate in the same place, without moving forward 
because the friction is insufficient for the wheels to move forward. On wet roads a water layer that exists between the road and the tire tends to reduce the friction between the two surfaces causing the vehicles to skid. The purpose of having grooves on the surface of  tyres is to allow water to pass through these grooves.

 Figure 5.7 – Tires with grooves to increase friction
● Coir ropes are formed by twisting a large number of coir fibers together. Even 
when a large force is applied on a rope, the fibres do not separate because of the 
friction among them. It is easier to untie a knot made with a nylon string than a knot made with a coir string.  This is because the frictional forces among the 
coir fibers are stronger than those among the nylon fibers.
● Moving vehicles can be brought to rest by applying brakes because of friction.   
As shown in figure 5.8, breaks of a bicycle operate by pressing the break-pads which are made of rubber on the wheel rim.  The bicycle stops because of the friction between the surfaces of the rubber break-pads and the wheels.

system is shown in figure 5.9.  In such systems, the frictional forces caused by 
pressing the break-pads against a disc attached to the wheel, are used to stop the 
wheels from rotating.

Summary
● When one of two bodies in contact with one another moves or tries to move 
relative to the other, the second body exerts a force that tends to stop this 
relative motion.  This phenomenon is known as friction.
● The frictional force that acts before the body begins to move is the static 
friction.  Static friction between the bodies varies with the external force that tries to cause the relative motion.
● The frictional force that acts when the relative motion between the two bodies 
just starts.
● Limiting friction between two bodies depends on the nature of the contact 
surfaces and the normal reaction.
● Limiting friction does not depend on the surface areas of the contact surfaces.
● The frictional force acting on a moving body is the dynamic friction.

6.1 Basic unit of life
In 1665, Robert Hooke observed a section of a cork using a microscope prepared 
by him. He discovered a structure like chambers in a beehive and he named them as cells. 
Figure 6.1- Robert Hooke, the microscope and the cells in a section of  the cork
Schleiden, Schwann and Radolf Virchow introduced the cell theory, based on the facts revealed by observing different live tissues through the microscope. 
The contents of the cell theory are as follows.
 y The structural and functional unit of life is the cell.
 y All organisms are made up of one or more cells.
 y New cells are formed from pre-existing cells.
6.2 Concept of the cell
The cell is the smallest structural unit of the organization of the living body.
The organisms composed of a single cell are called unicellular organisms and  those 
of many cells are called multicellular organisms.Cells perform different functions in the body ' Biology

For example - The transportation of oxygen is done by red blood cells.
   Transmission of impulses is done by neurons.  
Accordingly, the smallest bio unit that is adapted to perform a particular function is 
the cell. So it is clear that the structural and functional unit of life is the cell.
The cells differ from one another from their shape, size and function. Except few 
occasions, mostly cells are not visible to the naked eye. Therefore they have to be observed using the light microscope.
6.3 Structure of cells
Let’s do the following activities (01 and 02)  to study the structure of animal cells and plant cells.
To study the animal cells we will observe cheek cells and for the plant cells, let's 
take onion epidermal cells, as these cells are easily obtained.

• Typical cell
The small structures present within the cell to perform different functions are known as organelles.The types of organelles and the number of them differ according to the function performed by the cell.
The cell prepared by including all the organelles is known as the typical cell. In the

All animal cells are covered by a plasma membrane or a cell membrane. It is a live 
semi permeable membrane as well as a selective permeable membrane. There is a centralized nucleus in an animal cell. The cytoplasm is a gelatinous material.
The outer covering of the plant cell is the cell wall . It is made up of  cellulose. 
Inner to the cell wall is the plasma membrane. At the center of plant cell is a large vacuole. Generally there are no such vacuoles in animal cells. 
Animal cells as well as plant cells possess different organelles that perform different 
functions.
Most of the above organelles cannot be observed through the light microscope. 
Therefore the electron microscope should be used.

6.4 Cell organelles and structures present in a cell
Every organelle and structures present in a cell perform a specific function. 
Therefore the cell shows division of labour. 
 yCell wall
Figure 6'7The outer most covering of the plant cell is the cell wall. 
It is a dead structure. The main constituent of it is cellulose. The main functions of the cell wall are , to maintain the shape of the cell, support and protection of the cell.
 yPlasma Membrane (Cell membrane)
Figure  6.8Plasma membrane is present interior to the cell wall of plant cells.The boundary of the animal cell is the plasma membrane. It is made up of phospholipids and proteins. Plasma membrane is a semi permeable membrane. The main function of it is to enclose the cell, allow entry of water, ions, some molecules and thereby control the entry and exit of materials into and out of the cell. Plasma membrane is also known as cell membrane.
• Cytoplasm
The gelatinous liquid part of the cell excluding organelles is known as the cytoplasm. Inorganic and organic substances are present in it. The functions of the cytoplasm are to maintain a shape to the cell, bear cell organelles and carryout different metabolic processes.
The structures submerged in the cytoplasm are named as organnells. some organelles 
are surrounded by cell membranes. 
Eg.- mitochondrion, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex.
² Nucleus
Figure  6.9
    Nucleus is the main organelle in a cell. It is 
surrounded by a nuclear envelope. One or two 
nucleolus and the chromatin body are present inside the nucleus. During cell division, the chromatin body converts into chromosome. The functions of chromosomes are the storage of genetic material and transfer inherited characters from generation to generation.

The number of chromosomes is specific to a species.
Eg : There are 46 chromosomes in a human being.There are 26 chromosomes 
in a frog There are 24 chromosomes in a paddy plant.  
The main function of the nucleus is the control of life activities of the cell.
² Mitochondrion
Figure 6.10  It is an oval or rod shaped, membrane bounded organelle.
Aerobic respiratory reactions take place within the 
mitochondrion to release energy. So it is known as the power house of the cell. The energy produced within the mitochondrion is used for the metabolic activities of the cell.
² Golgi Complex
Figure 6.11   Membrane bounded sacs stacked on top of the other 
with associated secretory vesicles are collectively known as golgi complex.The functions of golgi complex is the production of secretory substances, packaging and secretion.
² Ribosome
Figure 6.12   They are small organelles without a membrane. It is made up 
of a large subunit and a small subunit. They can be found freely in the cytoplasm or attached to Endoplasmic Reticulum. The function of ribosome is providing place for the protein synthesis.

Endoplasmic reticulum become rough due to ribosomes attahed to the membrane. The function of it is the transportation of proteins within the cell.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
It is a network of tubular sacs without Ribosomes on the membrane. Synthesis of Lipids, steroids and to transport them within the cell are the functions of it. 
² Vacuole
Figure 6.14 It is a fluid filled large organelle found in plant cells which is 
surrounded by a membrane. The membrane that surrounds the vacuole is known as tonoplast. The fluid contained in it is known as the cell sap. Water, sugar, ions and pigments store within the vacuole. Generally no vacuoles are found and sometimes small vacoules may present in animal cells.Contractile vacuoles can be found in unicellular organisms. Maintenance of water balance, support and provision of colour to the cell by the pigments within it are the functions of the vacuole.

6.5 Cell Growth and Cell Division
● Cell growth  
Mature cellImmature cell
Figure 6.15
Mature cell
Immature cell
Growth is a basic feature of organisms. Growth 
of a cell is the irreversible increase of size or dry mass. But a cell has a maximum limit to grow. Beyond that level the cell will not grow, instead it divides.
● Cell division
The cell has the ability to grow and multiply its number. Accordingly a cell can multiply into two, four and eight cells. By multiplication new cells are formed. The cells multiply by cell division.
The cell division is the process by which new cells are formed by the division 
of cellular materials.
To complete the cell division of  an eukaryotic cell, first the nucleus should divide 
and then the cytoplasm.
Chromosomes contain and transfer genetic materials, the inherited characters from 
generation to generation (Before the division of nucleus). Chromosomes can be seen clearly as in the figures below.

The number of chromosomes in an ordinary somatic cell of a species is constant. 
That is specific to a species.
Example - There are 46 chromosomes in a chromosomal set of human somatic cells. 
This is comprised of 23 pairs of chromosomes. The same hereditary information is born by each pair of chromosomes.
A pair of chromosomes which contains same hereditary information is called as homologous pair of chromosomes. One of these homologous chromosomes is inherited from father where as the other is from mother.
Accordingly a child inherits 46 chromosomes receiving 23 chromosomes from 
father and 23 chromosomes from mother.
The cell division takes place in 2 methods.
● Mitosis
● Meiosis
Mitosis

It is the type of division which multiplies 
the number of cells by maintaining a constant number of chromosomes in the cells. First the nucleus divides and then the cytoplasm divides to produce two identical daughter cells equal to mother cell.

Figure 6.18The cell division that makes the 
number of chromosomes into half as 
the parent cell is the meiosis.    
Meiosis takes place during formation 
of gametes (eggs and sperms) in higher organisms. After the gametes being 
fused, the number of chromosomes 
of a species should be maintained, constant. For that the number of chromosomes should be halved during the formation of gametes and become n (haploid). 
  
Eggs and sperms possess only one chromosome of each pair of chromosomal set. 
(2n 
 n) When these gametes fuse to form the zygote, the chromosomes become 
n + n  2n again.
Meiosis takes place in 2 stages. The first stage is a meiotic division (reduction division) and the next is a mitosis.
During meiosis, structural changes occur in chromosome. Therefore, new variations 
or new characters appear in organisms and this is a very important phenomena in evolution.
Significance of Meiosis
 yMaintenance of the constant number of chromosomes from generation to 
generation.
 yHelp in evolution due to variations occur in chromosomes.

of sugar and a tablet of medicine, units like kilogram, gram and milligram can be used. But if the mass of very small particles such as a carbon dioxide molecule, or a helium atom is given in units like kilogram or gram, the value obtained is extremely small. Even the attogram (ag), the smallest units of mass is too large to indicate the mass of atoms or ions.  1 ag = 10
-18 g
For example, the mass of an atom of the lightest element, hydrogen (H) is 1.674x 10-24 g.
That is 0.000000000000000000000001674 g. Masses of some other atoms are given below.

  Mass of a chlorine (Cl) atom   = 5.903 x 10-23 g
  Mass of a potassium (K) atom = 6.476 x 10-23 g
It is cumbersome to use this type of small figures in calculations. 
For this reason, the mass of a selected atom was taken as a unit and the masses of 
the other atoms were given relative to it. The mass so expressed is known as the relative atomic mass. The relative atomic mass is not the true mass of an atom of an element. In the past, the mass of an atom of hydrogen, the lightest element was used as the atomic mass unit.07Chemistry

1.67 x 10-24 g. Find the relative molecular mass of water.

If the molecular formula of an element or a compound is known, its relative 
molecular mass can be calculated. This is because the relative molecular mass is equal to the sum of relative atomic masses of the atoms in a molecule.
For example a water molecule has two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom 
(O) bound together. Therefore, the relative molecular mass of water (H
2O) is the 
sum of the relative atomic masses of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
Since the relative atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 and oxygen is 16, the relative 
molecular mass of water can be calculated as follows.Mass of a molecule of an element or a compound

The ionic compounds such as sodium chloride (NaCl) exist as lattices but not 
molecules. Its formula is written to indicate the simplest ratio in which Na+ and 
Cl- ions are present in the ionic lattice. In such compounds what is calculated as the 
relative molecular mass is the mass relevant to their empirical formula. It is known as the relative formula mass or formula mass.

7.4 Mole
In various tasks, measurement of the amount of a substance is a requirement. A dozen of books means 12 books. Similarly 'ream' is used to measure the amount of papers. 
In the SI unit system, the unit used to measure the amount of a substance is the 
mole.
The mole is the amount of a substance that contains as many basic building 
units (atoms, molecules, ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12.00 g of C – 12 isotope. 
The number of basic units contained in a mole of any substance is a constant and it 
is equal to the Avogadro constant or 6.022 x 10
23. 
Thus, the relative atomic mass of any element taken in grams contains one mole of atoms or 6.022 x 10
23 atoms. The relative molecular mass of any substance taken in 
grams contains one mole of molecules or 6.022 x 1023 molecules.Cl₂

Quantification of Elements and Compounds Chemistry 
                   130 131 For free distribution For free distributionA mole of an element or a compound that exists as molecules means a mole of 
molecules of them.
Since mole is a unit that indicates a very large amount, it is not suitable to measure 
the amount of substances that we come across in day to day life. Therefore, the unit mole is practically used to measure the amounts of things such as atoms, molecules and ions which exist in very large numbers.
The following example illustrates the magnitude of the number representing a mole.Suppose there are 1000 million children in the world. This in powers of ten is,  
1000 million  } 1000 x 10
6 } 109 
If a mole of lozenges is equally distributed among these children,
The number of lozenges each child gets  
As the number of units belonging to a mole is very large, counting is impossible. 
Therefore, other methods are used to measure the mole. One method to have a mole of atoms of an element is weighing out its relative atomic mass in grams. For example, the relative atomic mass of sodium is 23. 
1 mol of sodium atoms  =  23 g  of sodium
In order to have a mole of molecules of a given compound, its relative molecular mass has to be weighed out in grams. For instance, the relative molecular mass of glucose (C
6H12O6) is 180.
1 mol of glucose molecules   = 180 g of glucose
• Molar Mass  
Molar mass is the mass of a mole of any substance.
Though relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass have no units, grams per 
mole (g mol-1) or kilograms per mole  (kg mol-1) is the unit of the molar mass.

The structure of a unicellular organism, is made up of the cytoplasm and organelles 
enclosed by a plasma membrane. This unicellular unit is an organism which shows living characteristics. When a water sample of a pond or hay extraction is observed using a microscope, unicellular organisms can be observed easily.

living condition is the cell. A group of cells modified to perform a specific function is called a tissue. A collection of tissues form an organ, a collection of organs forms a system, and systems collectively form an organism.
Below chart shows the organisational 
levels of an organism considering the blood circulatory system.
8.2 Nutrition
The process by which the energy and the materials are obtained for the maintenance of life is known as nutrition. Energy is needed for the cell growth and to repair the worn out structures. This energy is obtained by nutrients. The Organisms that produce their own food or the nutrients by themselves are known as autotrophic organisms.

For free distribution For free distribution 144 145Autotrophism can be divided into two categories according to the type of 
energy they use for food production. If light energy is used they are known as photoautotrophics and if energy is obtained by a chemical reaction they are  known as chemoautotrophics. Most of the plants are photoautotrophic. Most bacteria are chemoautotrophic. Production of food inside the chloroplast of plant cells using chlorophyll, which is a specific organic compound, is called photosynthesis.Photosynthesis can be expressed by the below equation.
Carbondioxide + Water
light energy
chlorophyll Glucose+ Oxygen
   6CO2 + 6H2 O light energy

The food produced in the leaves get stored in stems, roots and fruits. Animals are heterotrophic as they utilize food produced by plants or organic compounds with other living origins.

All Organisms need energy for their metabolism. They obtain this energy by 
breaking down of food inside the cell that they have produced or obtained by other means. The process by which the stored food is transformed into energy inside 
the cells is known as cellular respiration.Cellular respiration is a series of biochemical reactions. The respiration, which is an important characteristic of life, cannot be observed directly. But it can be observed using respiratory movements of some organisms. That is by inspiration, intake of oxygen for respiration and removal of carbon dioxide, the expiration.Using the below experiment it can be shown that CO
2 is released while O2 is 
absorbed during respiration.

When water is removed, an air flow occurs from bottle A to bottle E.
The colour of limewater in B does not change as CO2 in air that enters through P 
dissolves in KOH of vessel A. But after some time the limewater in vessel D turn 
to milky. It is because of the released CO2 by the frog during respiration. A control 
experiment can be used without a frog in C. Accordingly it is confirmed that CO2
is released as a byproduct of respiration. This experiment can be conducted again using germinating green gram / paddy/ maize/ bean seeds in vessel C instead of a frog.Activity 02

Method
Close the  flask with the cork lid connected to a rubber tube and a U tube . After sometime tighten the rubber tube and observe the water level in the U tube.  
when the flasks are closed with cork lids air inside is released through the rubber tube and pressure comes to equilibrium. Then rubber tubes are tightened to avoid gas exchange.
CO
2 released during respiration of seeds in apparatus A dissolves in KOH. O2 in the 
flask is absorbed by the seeds for respiration. To fill that gap, (reduction in volume 
of air) air in the tube flows into the flask. The water column in the glass tube is drawn up. So it is clear that O
2 is absorbed for respiration of organisms. No such 
change in B setup as absorbed volume of O2 is equal to the released volume of CO2.
Two assumptions are made in this experiment.(i) V olume of  CO
2 in the flasks is negligible.
(ii) In respiriation, absorbed volume of O2 is equal to the released volume of CO2

For free distribution For free distribution 146 1478.4 Irritability and Co-ordination
Organisms react according to the 
changes in the environment. When there is a change in the internal and external environment or a stimulus with a particular strength, organisms respond accordingly. A change which is strong enough to bring about a response is known as a stimulus. The stimuli are 
detected by organs such as eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin. The stimuli are 
light, sound, chemicals and mechanical or physical vibrations. 
The reactions according to the changes in the environment are known as responses. 
Eg: The stimulus is the sound and the response is closing of ears with hands as in the above diagram 8.10. 
The ability to respond to stimuli receives from internal or an external environment 
is known as irritability . The communication between different organs during 
responding to a stimulus is known as co-ordination. Nerves, muscles and hormones are important in co-ordination. Some insects fly towards light, some fly towards dark. Not only animals but also plants respond to stimuli.
Example : Leaves of Mimosa fold when touched. That means those plant   
  leaves are sensitive to touch. Leaves of Thora, Tamarind and     Sesbania fold at night. That means these plant leaves      are sensitive to light.
   
8.5 Excretion
All organisms obtain materials from the environment and transform them to a beneficial form of energy. At the same time the materials which are not used and the waste materials that are produced during the processes in the body are released to the environment. 
The sum of chemical and physiological activities or building up and breaking 
down of materials within the cell are known as metabolic activities. Removal of 
the  waste products from the body that are produced during metabolism is known as excretion.Figure 8.10- Responding towards stimuli

The main excretory materials of organisms are urea, salts, CO2 and water. There are 
organ systems present in the organism body for excretion. Nitrogenous excretion of 
human mainly takes place by the kidney.
Plants release CO2 during respiration, O2 during photosynthesis through lenticels 
and stomata of the leaves. That can be referred to as excretion too.
         For extra knowledge.
• Anabolism
The process of synthesis of complex compounds from simple compounds within the living body. Energy is stored during this process.
 ²Catabolism
The process of breaking down complex compounds into simple compounds in the body releasing energy is known as Catabolism.
 ²Metabolism
Summation of bio chemical reactions taking place in the living body or the total of anabolism and catabolism is known as Metabolism.
8.6 Movement  
Organisms fulfil their requirements (food, protection, reproduction) with the help of movement. During this, the whole organism or a part of the organism is moved. Unicellular organisms use cilia, flagella or pseudopodia for movement. 
For free distribution For free distribution 148 149Multicellular organisms move the whole body or a part of the body with the help of 
muscles. Most of them possess organs for locomotion.
E.g :- Fins, Wings, LegsSimilarly the organelles within the cell have the ability to  move. Movement is a 
living characteristic of organisms and it is essential for their existence.
You may have observed the growth of a shoot tip of a potted plant towards light 
which is placed closer to a window. The shoot apex of a plant grows towards light and the root apex towards the gravity. 
Organisms move as a response to stimuli. The stimuli may vary.
Examples : Light/darkness, Chemical substances, Gravitational force
   Heat/temperature, Vibrations/touch
 ²State different modes of locomotion of mammals and give two examples for each.
 ²For what purposes do organisms locomote?

8.7 Reproduction
What happens to the existence of the earth, if all the organisms die without producing their own offsprings? If so, the populations become extinct with time, one by one.Therefore before one generation dies, they have to produce their next generation. Production of a new generation by a unicellular or a multicellular organism for the continuation of their species is known as reproduction.Reproduction is of two types. They are sexual and asexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, gametes of two individuals sperm and an egg of the same species unite to form a zygote. The first cell of the process of producing a new organism is the zygote. During asexual reproduction, a single organism can produce an identical new offspring without the contribution of another organism.

The life of multicellular plants or animals starts from a single cell. Tissues which 
are modified to perform a specific function arise by the division of the above single cell, zygote.The zygote which is the result of the sexual reproduction of human develops into an embryo within the uterus and later transforms into an offspring. It is useful to study about the above process to understand the growth and development.
For free distribution For free distribution 150 151Mainly the increase in number of cells by the cell division contributes towards 
the growth of a multicellular organism. The growth of a unicellular organism is considered as the increase of the size and the volume of the cell. ( Paramecium, 
Yeast, Chlamydomonas) The cell growth means the irreversible increase of dry 
mass of the cell. Development means, the increase in the complexity of the cell. Accordingly, growth and development can be expressed in three steps.
1. Irreversible increase in size of the cell
2. Increase in number of cells by cell division3. Cell differentiationAuxanometer can be used to show the growth of a plant.

According to the above mentioned features, now you can identify living or non living things in the environment. 
Observe a white thread like mass on a pile of decomposing garbage. It is the 
somatic part (growth part) of a fungus. Later it transforms into mushrooms which are structures of sexual reproduction.
You can observe Lichen grows on a coconut trunk, ferns and orchids grow on a 
wall, mealy bugs on chili or papaw plants, small, fragile white eggs on leaflets of Sesbania and identify their living or non living nature.
Sometimes, living or non living nature of some substances cannot be identified 
easily. Bacteria cells can be dried into a powder. Yeast which is a fungus that is used to make bread is available in the market as a dried powder.
Some non living things show, living features in the environment. Formations of rocks by aggregation of soil, growth of crystals are some examples. Waves appear in reservoirs show a movement. Discuss how this movement and growth is different from that of living organisms.Assignment 8.5

bacteria. They show living or 
non living features according to their status. A virus is not considered as a cell. They are composed of a nucleic acid enclosed by a protein capsid. The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA. Viruses with different shapes and sizes have been identified.
Viruses do not possess any organelles for metabolic reactions. A virus becomes active only inside the host cells.

through electron microscope
         For extra knowledge.
The only living feature of virus is the reproduction. When a virus reaches an appropriate host  it hydrolyzes the cell membrane of the host cell and releases its RNA or DNA into it. The nucleic acid then multiplies within the host cell or produces thousands of viral particles.  A virus activity like an organism in this manner can only be seen inside a host cell.
 
Common plant viral diseases are banana bunchy top disease and curly leaf of chilies. Some animal viral diseases are influenza, common cold, Dengue and AIDS. It is important to prevent those diseases by knowing about them.
Organisms live in environments in which they can maintain their life. Therefore we 
can protect them by conserving those environments.protein

09Resultant force
9.1 The resultant of several forces
Figure 9.1 shows a motor car stalled on the road due to a mechanical fault being 
pushed by one person in the forward direction. Since the force exerted was not sufficient to move the vehicle, it did not move. Figure 9.2 shows two people trying to push the car. The motor car did not move in this attempt either. In Figure 9.3, three people are shown to push the motor car. In this attempt, the car has moved.
Figure 9.2 – Two persons pushing the car
Figure 9.3 – Three persons pushing the carFigure 9.1 – One person pushing a car
In order to move the car all the forces have to be applied in the direction that the car needs to be moved.
If many people take part in pushing the car instead of just one person, all the 
individual forces combine to form a larger force in the same direction and the task becomes easier.
The result of many people exerting forces in the same direction is that all the forces 
add up to give a larger single force.
156 157 For free distribution For free distributionWhen more than one force is applied, the single force that gives the 
same result as that of all the contributing forces is known as the resultant force of the individual contributing forces.
Forces applied on objects can have various directions. In this lesson will discuss about,
(i) the resultant of two collinear forces (forces having the same 'l i n e  o f  a c t i o n ' )                        
and
(ii) the resultant of two parallel forces (forces having parallel but different 'line 
of action')
9.2 Resultant of two collinear forces
Resultant of two collinear forces acting along the same direction
When pulling on fishing nets, the task can be accomplished more easily if a large 
group of people take part in pulling the net in the same direction. Because all the forces act in the same direction, the fishing net can be successfully pulled.  Here, all the forces are applied in the same direction and along the same line.
Figure 9.4 – A group of people pulling a fishing net
Now let us investigate a way of finding the resultant of two collinear forces acting 
along the same direction.

two strong strings to the ring as shown in Figure 9.5.  Pass the two strings over the two pulleys and connect the two Newton balances B and C to the other ends 
of the strings.  Fix the other end of the trolley to a wall through the third Newton balance A.

 ● Apply two forces from the two Newton balances B and C.  Record the readings 
of the balances.
 ● Record also, the reading of the balance A.
158 159 For free distribution For free distribution ●Find a relationship between the reading on the balance A and the readings 
recorded from B and C balances. 
 ● Applying different forces from the B and C, repeat the activity several times 
and find the relationship between the measurements.
You will observe that the sum of the readings of B and C is equal to the reading of A.
      That is, when two collinear forces act along the same direction, the 
resultant of the two forces is equal to the sum of the two individual forces
with a direction in the direction of forces.
Example 1
Two children are pulling a thread connected to a box placed on a table in the same 
direction.  The force applied by one child is 8 N while that of the other child is 6 N.  What is the resultant force with which the children are pulling the box?
    8 N 6 N 
The resultant force applied by both children    = 8 N + 6 N 
          = 14 N

(2) A child is pushing an object placed on a table with a force of 5 N in a certain

160 161 For free distribution For free distributionResultant of two collinear forces acting along opposite 
directions
Have you seen the national sport of pulling ropes during the Sinhala new year 
season?  The participants of such competitions form two groups and pull a rope in two directions.  The rope will be dragged in the direction of the resultant force which lies in the direction of the larger force.
Figure 9.6 – Pulling a rope
  
When we want to pull an object along a certain direction, the resultant force or the 
net force of forces applied along that direction is given by the summation of the forces.
The result of applying forces in various directions is a non-utilization of the forces 
productively.
It is possible to obtain a large net force only if all the contributing forces are applied 
in the same direction.
It is an experience that in order to drag a heavy object along the floor easily, the 
object should be pushed from behind and pulled from the front.
Go carts used to carry children can be pulled from the front or pushed from the back 
in order to move it.  If both a pull from the front and a push from the back are given to the go cart, moving the cart would be easier as a large resultant will operate on the cart.
Now let us find the resultant of two collinear forces acting in opposite directions.  
In order to do it, let us engage in the following activity.

Figure 9.7 - Forces acting in opposite directions on a trolley
 ●Place the trolley on a table as shown in Figure 9.7 and fix two pieces of string to the two ends of the trolley. Allow the other ends of the pieces of string to pass over the two pulleys and attach two Newton balances A and B.
 ● Record your observations on the motion of the trolley after applying a 4 N 
force on each balance.
 ● Record your observations on the motion of the trolley after applying a 4 N 
force on the balance A and a 6 N force on balance B.
 ● Repeat the above step applying a 6 N force on the balance B and a 6 N force 
on the balance A.
You will observe that the trolley does not move in the first case.  The trolley remains in equilibrium under the action of the two equal forces acting on it in opposite directions.  
In the second instance, the trolley moves in the direction of the Newton balance 
B.  Here, there are two inequal forces acting on the trolley in opposite directions and the trolley moves in the direction of the larger force. The extra force which is applied in the direction of A than in the direction of B is 2 N. That is, in this instance the resultant is 2 N in the direction of B. 
In the third instance, the trolley does not move. Here, the resultant is zero since the two forces acting in the opposite directions become equal.
162 163 For free distribution For free distributionWhen two collinear forces are exerted on an object in opposite directions, 
the resultant is given by their difference, with a direction in the direction of the larger force.

What is the magnitude and the direction of the resultant of a force of 5 N pulling an 
object placed on a table in a certain direction and another force of 2 N pulling it in the opposite direction?
          Resultant force = (5 N) + (-2N)
         = 3 N
The object will be pulled by a force of 3 N in the direction of the 5 N force.

Let us now investigate instances where two parallel forces which are not collinear 
are in action, and how to find the resultant of these two parallel forces.
Let us consider this example.
150 N
Figure 9.8 – One person trying to push a 
motor carOne person is trying to push 
a motor car with a force of 150 N in the direction as shown in Figure 9.8, but it has not moved.

150 N
200 NHowever, when the assistance 
of another person pushing the car with a force of 200 N was obtained and the car was pushed by both persons, in the direction shown the car moved.  It was because the resultant of the two forces is sufficient for the motion of  the car.
Although both these forces were applied in the same direction, they are not collinear.  They are two parallel forces acting on two different points of the motor car. However, that when two forces act along the same direction the resultant is the sum of the two forces.
Resultant of the two forces        = 150 N + 200 N 
(since both forces act in the same 
direction)  
                                                      =  350 N   
To experimentally check that the resultant of two parallel forces are equal to their 
sum, let us do the following activity.

 ●Drill three holes X, Y and Z on the strip of wood as shown in the figure below 
and attach the three Newton balances A,B and C. Pull the three balances

Figure 9.10 - Finding the resultant of two

 ● When the strip of wood is at rest, you would observe that the sum of the readings 
of the Newton balances A and B is equal to that of the Newton balance C. What 
is the reason for this?  It is because the resultant of the two forces on A and B is 
equal to the magnitude of the force on C.
In order to find the resultant of two parallel forces acting along the same 
direction, the two forces must be added.
One of the best uses we can get from a knowledge of resultant force is to make use of a large number of small forces in place of a single large force effectively.  X

Summary
 ● The single force acting in place of many forces (the single force that gives the 
same result as many forces) is known as the resultant force.
 ●The magnitude of the resultant of two forces acting in the same direction is 
the sum of the two forces. Direction of the resultant is the direction of an individual  forces.
 ● If the magnitudes of two collinear forces acting in opposite directions are 
different, then the magnitude of their resultant is equal to the difference between the two forces and acts in the direction of the larger force.
 ●The resultant of two inclined forces act in a direction which lies between the two forces.

The English alphabet contains 26 letters. Yet, the combination of them forms a 
large number of words. There is only a limited number of elements. In spite of that, millions of compounds are formed by their chemical combination. 
Though most of the elements form chemical compounds, there are some elements 
which do not form compounds under normal conditions. Helium, neon and argon are examples. These elements occurring as single atoms in nature exist as gases. They are known as noble gases.
What is the reason why many elements form compounds but not the noble gases? 
This can be explained by taking into consideration the electronic configuration of elements.

The outermost shell carrying electrons in an atom of an element is known 
as its valence shell.The valence shell of the atoms of neon and argon has eight electrons each. This electronic structure has been identified as a stable electronic configuration. Because of this stable configuration their reactivity is very low, so they are referred to as noble gases. But, the state of sodium and chlorine atoms is different. In order to have the stable noble gas configuration, a sodium atom has to either lose the electron in the last shell or gain seven electrons. Similarly a chlorine atom can attain the stable electronic configuration by receiving a single electron or by removing seven electrons. In the atoms of these element, electrons in the valence shell reorganise to acquire the stable electronic configuration. That means, loss, gain or sharing of electrons occurs.
The attractive forces or binding among the atoms or ions resulted by the 
rearrangement of electrons in the valence shell for stabilizing the atoms of elements as described above are called chemical bonds. 
According to the way the participating atoms behave when they chemically bind 
together, the chemical bonds can be divided into two types. 
1. Ionic bonds2. Covalent bonds
10.1 Ionic Bonds
The electronic configuration of the sodium atom is 2, 8, 1. Sodium is an element with low electronegativity. As the number of protons in a sodium atom is equal to the number of electrons, an atom of sodium is electrically neutral (Fig. 10.1).

 Neutral atoms form positively charged ions by losing electrons. Neutral atoms form negatively charged  ions  by  gaining electrons. Some polyatomic  groups too bear positive or negative charges (e.g. NH
4+, SO42-  
, NO 3- ). An ion is an atom or a group of atoms with an  electrical  
charge.   
Now let us examine how the compound sodium chloride is formed. The sodium ions formed by the sodium atoms by losing electrons and the chloride ion formed by chlorine atoms by gaining electrons are oppositely charged. These ions by virtue of their opposite charges strongly bind together by electrostatic attractive forces to form the compound sodium chloride with ionic bonds. This process is illustrated in Fig. 10.5.

The bonds formed due to the strong electrostatic attractions between the 
positive and negative ions produced by the exchange of electrons among atoms are known as ionic bonds or electrovalent bonds. So, sodium chloride is a compound with ionic bonds. Such compounds are called ionic compounds.

during the formation of sodium chloride.

The attractions among the ions in the compound sodium chloride is not limited to a single pair of Na
+ and Cl- ions. Owing to the attractions, a large number of positive 
and negative ions arrange themselves to form a regular three dimensional array where six Na
+ ions surround every Cl- ion and six Cl- ions surround every Na+ ion. 
This arrangement gives rise to the crystal lattice of sodium chloride known as an 'ionic lattice' (Fig. 10.7). In all ionic compounds the ions are organised in a three dimensional lattice.

10.2  Covalent Bonds
Electron sharing between atoms is another method of forming bonds among them. 
By sharing of electrons like this, the atoms acquire the noble gas configuration. Joining of atoms by sharing electrons between a pair of atoms is referred to as a covalent bond. 
Sharing of electrons between atoms of the same kind gives rise to homoatomic 
molecules.
e.g. hydrogen (H
2), fluorine (F2), oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2) 
Sharing of electrons between atoms of different elements gives rise to heteroatomic 
molecules.
e.g. water (H2O), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3)
a). Fluorine molecule  
The electronic configuration of a fluorine atom is 2, 7. By sharing a pair of electrons, 
two fluorine atoms acquire the stable electronic configuration. The result of this is the bonding of two fluorine atoms covalently to form a fluorine molecule (Fig.10.8).

In the ammonia molecules nitrogen atom is the central atom and hydrogen atoms 
are the peripheral atoms. There are three bond pairs and a single lone pair in the valence shell of the ammonia molecule.
In all the molecules given above, the central atom as well as the peripheral atoms 
have acquired the noble gas configuration. That means, except in hydrogen, a set of eight electrons is completed in the valence shell of atoms after the formation of the bonds. Those are known as the  compounds in which the octet of electrons is complete.Nevertheless, there are exceptions too. Let's take aluminium chloride (AlCl
3) as an 
example. In this, the electronic configuration of the aluminium atom is 2, 8, 3. The electronic configuration of a chlorine atom is 2, 8, 7. Three chlorine atoms share three pairs of electrons with an aluminium atom to form an AlCl
3 molecule.
Cl
Cl ClAl In this molecule, the valence shell of the aluminium atom contains 
six electrons. In the case of a chlorine atom, the octet is complete.
In contrast, there are instances where the octet of electrons in the 
valence shell is expanded. Phosphorus penta chloride (PCl5)  is an example. The 
electronic configuration of phosphorus is 2, 8, 5. The electronic configuration of 
chlorine is 2, 8, 7. A phosphorus atom and five chlorine atoms share five pairs of electrons to form the PCl
5 molecule.Then 
there are10 electrons around the central phosphorus atom. In each chlorine atom, the octet is completed.
 yAtomic Lattice
In some elements the atoms are organised as a lattice. Such lattices in which the                                                                                                                                              atoms are covalently bonded are known as atomic lattices. Carbon naturally occurs as two forms of atomic lattices, graphite and diamond. They are known as the allotropic forms of carbon. These two forms differ in the way the carbon atoms form covalent bonds with one another. Generally the melting points and  boiling points  of covalent compounds are low. But in diamond and graphite, the melting point and boiling point are high due to their atomic lattice structure.PCl

 yGraphite
Graphite consists of layers of carbon atoms formed by the joining of one carbon 
atom with three other carbon atoms by single bonds. These layers are superimposed on one other. The forces holding these layers are weak. Thus one layer can easily slide over the other. Because of this structure, graphite behaves as a lubricant.

Diamond 
Diamond is a three dimensional lattice in which every carbon atom forms four single bonds with four other carbon atoms. Diamond is the hardest substance found in nature. 
10.3  Polarity of Bonds 
Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons of a chemical bond towards itself. It takes different values for different atoms. Then hydrogen molecule is formed by the joining of two hydrogen atoms of equal electronegativity by a covalent bond. The distribution of electrons in the bond pair of this molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, the hydrogen is a non – polar molecule. But when two atoms of different electronegativities are joined by a covalent bond, the attraction imposed by the two atoms on the bond pair is different. Let us take hydrogen fluoride molecule as an example. Since fluorine is more electronegative than hydrogen, the bond pair is more displaced towards the fluorine atom. So, the electron distribution is not symmetrical. Consequently the fluorine atom bears a small negative charge. This is known as polarization. However the molecule HF as a whole is a neutral molecule.

When two atoms of unequal electronegativities are joined by a covalent bond, it 
gets polarized due to asymmetric distribution of electrons. Such bonds are called polar covalent bonds.
In case where two atoms of similar or slightly different electronegativities are 
joined by a covalent bond, the bonding electrons between those two atoms distribute symmetrically. Such covalent bonds are referred to as non – polar covalent bonds.
In the water molecule, there are four pairs of electrons in the valence shell of its 
oxygen atom. Of them two pairs are bond pairs and two pairs are lone pairs.
When an O – H bond of a water molecule is considered, the bond pair shifts more 
towards the more electronegative oxygen atom. Thus the molecule is polarized  so that the oxygen atom bears a partial negative charge while the hydrogen atom carries a partial positive charge. Hence water is a compound with polar covalent bonds.
In three dimensional space water molecule is disposed as follows. It assumes an 
angular shape (Fig. 10.19).

10.4 Intermolecular Bonds
In water molecules the hydrogen atoms which bear a very small positive partial charge forms attractive forces with oxygen atoms bearing a very small negative charge of the neighbouring water molecules. This kind of attractions among the molecules are known as intermolecular forces or intermolecular bonds.

These intermolecular forces are not as strong as the covalent bonds between the 
oxygen atoms and the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule. Yet, these intermolecular forces impart many special properties to water.
Because of these intermolecular forces, water exists as a liquid at room temperature. 
In case that there were no intermolecular forces among the water molecules, water is a gas at room temperature.

The bulb lights in the circuits with common salt and copper sulphate solutions. It doesn’t light in the circuits with the sugar solution and distilled water. Common salt and copper sulphate are compounds with ionic bonds. Hence, aqueous solutions of ionic compounds conduct electricity. Sugar and water are covalent compounds. Electricity does not flow through them. Experiment shows that even common salt in the fused state conducts electricity. This confirms that electricity flows through ionic compounds in aqueous solution and fused state. However electricity does not flow through ionic compound in solid state.

11.1 Moment
We have seen that by applying forces on objects, it is possible to push, pull or lift 
them.  Similarly, it is possible to rotate objects by applying forces on them. That is, by applying a force we can rotate or turn an object around a given point.  In this lesson, we will focus our attention on the ability of a force to rotate an object around a given point.
Let us do the following activity in order to investigate the factors affecting the 
rotation of an object.
Mark four points A, B, C, D on the 
same horizontal level of a door 
attached to its frame by two hinges.  Attach a Newton balance to the point A with the aid of a rubber sucker clamp and apply a perpendicular force on the door to open it. Measure the force necessary to slightly move the door using the Newton balance.  Repeat this procedure for the other three points B, C and D and record your measurements 
in Table1 11.1 given below.

Figure 11.2 – Axis of rotation of the doorHere, the door  rotates around an axis passing through the hinges as shown in Figure 11.2.  This axis is known as the axis of rotation of the door.
It would be clear to you that the force required to rotate the 
door decreases when the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force from the rotation axis is increased.  It would also be clear to you from your measurements that the force required to rotate the door increases when the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force from the rotation axis is decreased.
This means that it is easier to open the door when the applied 
force is further away from the rotation axis, while it is more difficult to open when the applied force is closer to the  rotation axis. 
It is clear from the above activity that the force required to rotate an object around an axis depends on the perpendicular distance to the force from the axis.
The product of the force and the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the 
force from the axis of rotation is known as the moment of the force  around the 
axis.
190 191 For free distribution For free distributionIn order to subject a body to a motion in a straight line, a force is required.  In order 
to rotate an object around a given axis, what is required is not just a force but a moment. A moment required to rotate an object is created by applying a force at a certain distance from the rotation axis.  This tendency for rotation due to the action of a force is known as the turning effect of the force.
Therefore, we can write an equation for the moment due to a force as defined below.
 Moment due to  =    force   ×   perpendicular distance from the rotational axis to the                line of force of action 
 a force             N        m
The unit of moment of a force is N m.
Since the moment is a tendency for rotation, depending on whether the rotation is clockwise or anticlockwise, the moment too has to be clockwise or anticlockwise.
 ●Investigation of the dependence of the moment on the magnitude of the force.
Let us carry out the following activity in order to investigate the dependence of the moment on the magnitude of the force.

 ●Now attach a loop formed with a piece of wire to each of the holes at A, B, C 
and D on the stick.  Attach the Newton balance on the ring at D as shown in 
figure 11.4 and measure the minimum force necessary to barely move the stick, keeping the balance perpendicular to the stick.  The axis of rotation in this case is the axis passing from the centre of the nail head down through the nail.
 ●Next, rotate the nail half a turn to tighten the stick a little more and measure the force required to slightly move the stick.
 ●Again, rotate the nail half a turn to tighten the stick further and measure the force required to slightly move the stick.
 ●Tabulate your measurements. What is the result that you have expected ?
Suppose you obtained the results shown in the table below.  (You may obtain values different to the values given depending on your set up.)

You will see that the force required to initiate the turning effect increases as the stick is tightened. Since the distance to the line of action of the force is maintained constant this confirms that the moment depends on the magnitude of the force.O

● Repeat the procedure, tightening the screw by another ¼ th of a turn and

● Tabulate your measurements.Activity  3

The above results show that when the force necessary to initiate the turning effect is kept constant, perpendicular distance to the Newton balance had to be increased as the strip is tightened
This confirms that the moment of force also depends on the perpendicular distance 
to the force from the point of suspension.

When a force acting on an object, depending on the direction of rotation, moments can be classified as clockwise or anti - clockwise.

the resultant moment  = F1 × d1 - F2 × d2 
Here, clockwise moment is considered as positive.
If the opposite moments are equal, (that is F1 × d1 = F2 × d2 ) the object will not 
rotate, and it will be in equilibrium.

196 197 For free distribution For free distribution11.2    The couple of forces
To rotate an object with a single force that object must be pivoted to a fixed point. 
It is possible to rotate an object that is not pivoted, with the use of two forces acting in opposite directions.            
         
Figure 11.7 - Demonstration of couple 
of forcesAX

A        
Consider the case of a strip of wood 
being pierced at the center and fixed with 
a screw to a table as shown in the figure. Attach a Newton balance as shown and measure the force (F) when the rod begins to rotate slightly.
Next, attach two Newton balances at 
both ends A and B and measure the force required to slightly rotate the rod.  If the force required with one force had been F, 
the force required when two forces are applied in opposite direction would be F/2. Note that the two forces act on the 
same plane (coplaner).
   
  
From the above activity, it would be clear 
to you that when applying forces to rotate or turn an object around a certain axis it is easier to rotate by applying two equal forces in opposite directions.
                                            
When a couple of forces is applied on an object, the resultant of the two forces is 
zero as the two forces of equal magnitude and act in opposite direction.  Therefore, a couple of forces does not cause a linear displacement in an object.  However, the object rotates around a point between the two forces.
The moment of a force couple is defined as the product between the magnitude of 
one force and the perpendicular distance between the lines of actions of the two forces.O
                                            Two coplanar forces of equal magnitudes acting in opposite directions, along two lines of action that are spaced apart are known as a couple of forces.
198 199 For free distribution For free distribution                                Moment of a couple of  forces  = force × perpendicular distance between
       (N) the lines of action of the two 
     forces (m)
                 
The unit of the moment of a couple of forces is N m.      
        Moment of a couple of forces = F x d
Where F  =    force   d = perpendicular distance 
       between the lines of                       action of the two forces
If we want to rotate an object by a single force as done by attaching one Newton
balance to the point A and pulling the object as in the example above, then the 
object has to be pivoted at a certain point.  (What happens here is the formation of a force couple due to the action force we apply and the reaction force generated at the pivot according to Newton’s third law.)  However, it is possible to rotate even a free object by applying a force couple as done in the example of applying two forces at points A and B with two Newton balances

Summary
●   What is meant by the moment of a force is the tendency of an object to rotate 
      as a result of a force acting on it.
●  The moment of a force is given by the product between the force and the
     perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force from a selected axis.
 That is,
    Moment due to a force = force  x  perpendicular distance to the line of action 
                                                     of the force from a selected axis.
●    A couple of forces is a pair of two equal forces that are parallel to one another    
and acting in opposite directions on an object so as to turn or rotate it. 
●  A couple of forces can rotate an object without causing a linear motion in the      object.

Figure 12.1 – Two groups pulling a rope
In a competition of pulling a rope, two groups pull the rope in two opposite directions.  
When the force exerted in one direction becomes greater than the force exerted in the other direction, the rope moves in the direction of the larger force.  When both groups pull with equal forces, the rope will remain at rest without moving in either direction. The sum of the two forces becomes zero. In this situation the rope is said 
to be in equilibrium under the action of the forces in the two directions.

Here there are two forces acting on the 
object. One force is the weight of the object 
which arises due to the gravitational force.  
The other is the upward force exerted by the 
spring of the balance in order to keep the object from falling onto the ground.  Under the action of these two forces, the object remains at rest.  That is, the object is in equilibrium under the two forces.

Figure 12.3 – A sphere 
suspended by a stringA sphere suspended by a string is shown in Figure 12.3.  The weight of the sphere is acting vertically downwards.  The sphere remains at rest as the vertically upward force applied by the string, balances the force due to its weight (The force applied by the string is called its tension). In this instance, the sphere remains in equilibrium under the downward force due the weight (W) and the upward force (T) exerted by the string.
In daily life, we come across situations where various forces 
act on objects quite frequently.  Objects can remain in equilibrium under two, three or even many forces.
Here we will consider instances where objects remain in equilibrium under two or 
three forces.
12.2    Equilibrium of a body under two forces
We learnt about the effective force or the resultant force of two collinear forces (forces acting along the same line) acting on a point, in the lesson on resultant force.
In that lesson, you have learnt that, while a certain force is acting on an object, if it 
is pulled by another force in the opposite direction, the magnitude of the resultant force decreases. When an object is said to be in equilibrium, what is meant is that the resultant force of the two forces acting on the object is zero.
Now let us investigate the factors required to keep an object in equilibrium under 
two forces acting in opposite directions along the same line. 
Let us do activities 1 and 2 for this purpose.
Items required : a ring, two spring balances
Figure 12.4 - Examine the equilibrium of an object under two forcesActivity  1
202 203 For free distribution For free distribution ●Place the ring horizontally on a table and pull it with the two balances in 
opposite directions as shown in Figure 12.4.  By varying the extent of the pull, apply forces of varying magnitudes on the object.  In each attempt, the ring must be kept at rest.
 ●The ring stays at rest only when it is in equilibrium under the action of the two forces in opposite directions.  Every time the ring is in equilibrium, you will observe that the readings of the two spring balances are equal.
That is, at equilibrium, the two forces are equal in magnitudes.
Now try to maintain equilibrium without having the two forces along the same 
line.  You will find that this is impossible.  That is, every time the two forces are in equilibrium, they must be aligned along the same line and their directions must be opposite to one another.
Items required : a cubic shaped block of wood, two Newton balances, two rings    
to fix the balances to the wooden block
 ●Fix the two rings to the centers of two opposite faces of the block of wood as 
shown in Figure 12.5.
 ●Now attach the two Newton balances to the two rings and pull the block of wood along the two directions applying forces of various magnitudes.
  
Figure 12.5 – Pulling a block of wood in two directions
  Activity  2
 
You will observe that the block of wood moves in one direction whenever there is a 
nonzero resultant force and that it remains stationary whenever the resultant force is zero.  That is, every time the block of wood is in equilibrium, the two forces acting on it in opposite directions have equal magnitudes.

In this case, the weight of the object, acting vertically downwards, is balanced by 
the perpendicular reaction force exerted vertically upwards by the table.  That is, the object is in equilibrium under the action of the two forces mentioned above and the object remains at rest.  
          
Figure 12.7 - An object suspended by a stringtention  (T)
weight (W)If an object suspended by a string as shown in Figure 12.7 remains in equilibrium, the reason is that a force equal to the weight of the object is acting vertically upwards along the string.  The force exerted upwards by the string is known as the tention of the string.  As the object is held in equilibrium by two forces - its weight and the tension of the string - the object remains at rest. 
In each of the instances described above, only two forces were acting on the object.  In addition, the two forces were equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.  Also, their lines of action were the same. That is, for an object to remain in equilibrium, the following conditions must be satisfied.
1. The two forces must have equal magnitudes.
2. The two forces must act along two opposite directions.3. Both forces must lie along the same line of action.

Also, all three strings are parallel.  This is an example of a system in equilibrium under the action of three parallel, coplanar forces.  (There are four forces acting in the system if the weight of the rod is considered.  However, by a "light rod" 
we mean a rod whose weight is negligibly small. Therefore, we do not consider that force here.)

Now, let us engage in the following activity in order to investigate the factors that 
affect the equilibrium of three parallel and coplanar forces.

the aid of the rubber bands and balances as shown in Figure 12.10 and keep the meter ruler in equilibrium in a horizontal position.  Take measurements of the two spring balances.  The system is now in equilibrium under the action of three parallel, coplanar forces.
 ●Investigate the relationship between the measurements of the two spring balances and the weight of the meter ruler.  You will notice that the sum of the two readings of the balances is equal to the weight of the meter ruler.
 ●That is, the sum of the two forces exerted on the meter ruler by the two balances is equal to the weight of the meter ruler.
 ●See whether it is possible to push the meter ruler in a horizontal plane with a force applied normal to the meter ruler at one end of the ruler and still maintain equilibrium.
 ●You will understand that every time the meter ruler is in equilibrium, the two balances and the meter ruler are in the same plane. Activity  3
That is, in order for an object to maintain equilibrium under the action of three parallel forces, the following conditions must be satisfied.
(i) The three forces must be coplanar.
(ii) One force must have a direction opposite to the other two forces.
(iii) The resultant of any two forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in 
direction to the third force.

² The point of intersection of the three lines can be considered as the center of 
gravity of the laminar.
	Center of gravity is the point at which the whole weight of a body may be considered to act. Therefore, the weight of the laminar acts along the verticle line that goes through its centre of gravity.
² Hang the laminar using two strings connected to it, as the framed picture 
shown in Figure 12.12 and keep it in equilibrium in a vertical plane.
² Mark the lines of each string on a sheet kept behind the laminar. Mark also, 
the vertical line passing through the center of gravity.
 All three lines marked above will lie on the same plane and they will pass through a common point.
²  Now, keeping the position of one of the three forces fixed, turn the laminar to 
change the plane of the other forces. You will observe that, the system remains equilibrium only after readjusting the lines of action of the forces so as to have all three forces lying on the same plane.  Activity  4
That is, in order for a system of three non parallel  forces to be in equilibrium, the three forces must be coplanar.  Also, the lines of action of the three forces must meet at a common point.  Furthermore, the resultant of any two of the forces should be equal to the third force in magnitude, and opposite in direction.

Summary
² If the magnitudes of two collinear forces applied on an object are equal 
and they have opposite directions, then the object is in equilibrium. 
² An object under three parallel forces is in equilibrium if one force is 
equal in magnitude to the resultant of the other two forces and it is in the 
opposite direction.
  eg;  
    
² If an object stays in equilibrium under three forces that are not parallel 
to one another, when the resultant of any two of the forces is equal in 
magnitude and opposite in direction to the other force.  
        
When the resultant of the two forces A and B is applied in the dirction of the 
force C, the three forces will be in equilibrium.
² Even under the action of more than three forces, a system can remain in 
equilibrium by applying forces appropriately.
