1Living tissues 01
You have studied about tissues as one of the organizational levels of multicellular 
organisms in grade 10. You will learn more about tissues in this chapter.
1.1 Plant tissues
Let's do the activity 1.1 to study about plant tissues.
Materials required :- Thin peel of lower epidermis of betel leaf, thin section 
of a potato tuber, thin cross section of a stem of a plant like Balsam.
Method         :- ²  Prepare temporary slides using above plant materials. 
 ²  Observe them under microscope.
²  Try to identify tissues formed by cells with the help of   
your teacher.
Figure. 1.1 - View of different plant tissues under optical microscopeActivity 1.1
You may have observed that plant tissues are of different forms. Animal tissues are also of  different forms. It is observable that different cell types are present in living beings and similar cells are arranged together.
A group of cells with a common origin that has been modified to perform 
particular functions in the body is known as a tissue.Biology

 ² Classification of plant tissues
Let's do the activity 1.2 to study further about how tissues are oraganized in plant 
organs.
Materials  required :- Prop root of Banion/ Stilt root of Pandanus/ Stilt root 
of Rampe.
Figure 1.2 - External view of a rootMethod         :-
 ²Observe the external view of the growing tips of above roots. 
 ²Use a hand lens to observe them.Activity - 1.2
We can identify the nature of a growing root from the above observation. Growing part is soft and light coloured. Mature part is rough and dark coloured. This is because of the nature of tissues.
Figure 1.3 shows the microscopic view of longitudinal section of such a root.

ability of cell division. Region B-B' contain different cell types that are different in nature from cells in  region A-A'.
Plant tissues can be categorised using different 
criteria. Plant tissues can be divided into two groups according to the ability of cell division.
 ² Meristematic tissues 
 ² Permanent tissues
Permanent tissues can be found in region B-B' and Meristematic tissues in  region A-A' as shown in figure 1.3.
For free distributionLiving tissues  Biology
31.1.1 Meristematic tissues
The tissues with cells that divide actively by mitosis to produce new cells are called 
meristematic tissues. These cells are not differentiated. The growth of plants takes place due to activity of meristematic tissues. 
Features of meristematic tissues
 ²This tissue consists of small sized living cells
 ²No intercellular spaces or intercellular spaces are not prominent
 ²There is a distinct nucleus in each cell
 ²Absence of large central vacuole but small vacuoles may be present
 ²Absence of chloroplasts
 ²Large number of mitochondria are present
Meristematic tissues are present in specific locations of the plant. They are of three 
types.
Apical Meristems
Intercalary meristems
Lateral Meristems
B A
Figure 1.4 -  Locations of meristematic 
tissuesApical meristems
Apical meristems are found in shoot apex, root apex and axillary buds. Plant increases its height due to the activity of this tissue.
Intercalary meristemsIntercalary meristems are found at nodes. The 
length of internode increases due to the activity of the above tissue. They are found in plants of grass family.
Lateral meristemsLateral meristems are present laterally in the 
stem and roots of plant. They are found parallel to the longitudinal axis of plant. The diameter of the plant increases due to the activity of this tissue. Cambium tissue found in dicots is a lateral meristematic tissue.

1.1.2 Permanent tissues
Do the activity 1.3 to identify different types of tissues of plant stem.
Materials  required :- Pumpkin / Tridex plant stem, A glass slide,                  
    A  microscopeMethod         :-
 ²Observe the cross section of above plant stem  using a microscope
 ²Identify the different tissue types present in them 
Figure 1.5 -  Microscopic view of cross section of dicot stemActivity -- 1'3
A tissue that lost its ability to divide and specialized to perform a particular function is known as a permanent tissue.
According to the nature of the permanent tissues, it can be grouped into two.
 ²Simple Permanent tissues       -   One type of cells collected together
 ²Complex Permanent tissues    -  Different types of cells collected together
 ² Simple permanent tissues
The tissue is composed of similar cells. According to the shape of cell and the nature 
of cell wall, three types of simple permanent tissues as parenchyma, collenchyma 
and sclerenchyma can be identified  in plants (Figure 1.6).

5Parenchyma
The tissue that forms the soft parts of the plant body is the parenchyma tissue. This 
is the most abundant tissue found in the plant.
Features of Parenchyma tissue
 ²Parenchyma tissue consists 
of  living cells.
 ²Cells are isodiametric 
(spherical) with a large central vacuole.
 ²Nucleus is present peripherally in the cytoplasm.
 ²The cell wall is thin and made up of cellulose.
 ²Intercellular spaces are present.

 ²Cortex and pith of plant stem   ² Pith and cortex of roots
 ²Fleshy parts of fruits  ² Seeds (endosperm)  
 ²Leaves (mesophylls)
Functions of parenchyma
²   Photosynthesis     - Palisade and spongy mesophylls in plant leaves contain chlorophyll within chloroplasts. Photosynthesis takes place within these chloroplasts.
²   Food storage      - Food is stored in some parenchyma tissues and they  are called as storage tissues.
E.g. : Potato tuber, Carrot and Sweet potato roots, Papaw and Banana fruits.
²  Storage of water    -  Specially xerophytic plants store water in Parenchyma tissue.
E.g. : Aloe leaves, Bryophyllum leaves, Cactus cladode
²  Providing support  -  Herbaceous plants like Balsam absorb water into 
vacuoles of  the parenchyma cells. Thereby cells become turgid and provide  mechanical support to the plant.

Features of collenchyma tissue
 ²Collenchyma tissue consists of  living cells.
 ²Cells possess a cytoplasm, nucleus and central vacuole.
 ²Generally cells are elongated and polygonal in cross section.
 ²The corners of the cell walls are thickened. 
 ²Intercellular spaces may present or may not present.
Locations of collenchyma
The collenchyma forms a cylindrical tissue inner to the epidermis of herbaceous 
stems. They are found in the veins of dicot leaves.
Functions of collenchyma
1' Support         - Collenchyma provides mechanical support to dicot plant 
stem, before the formation of wood. (Provides mechanical support to herbs)
 This tissue provides support to the plant leaves by the collenchyma in veins.
2' Photosynthesis   -  Chloroplasts are  found in the collenchyma of immature dicot stems. Photosynthesis is carried out by those cells.

Sclerenchyma tissue helps in providing mechanical strength and support to the 
plant body.  This tissue has two types of cells as sclereids and  sclerenchyma fibres.
Features of sclerenchyma tissue
 ²Sclerenchyma tissue consists of dead cells.
 ²Lignin is deposited on the cellulose cell wall.
 ²Cells are tightly packed. Therefore, no intercellular spaces.
 ²Cell wall is evenly thickened and forms a central lumen.
Locations of sclerenchyma tissue
Fibres present in xylem are called as xylem fibres and in phloem as phloem fibres. 
Other than above, coconut fibres, agave fibres and cotton wool are made up of fibres (sclerenchyma)
Selereids are  found in endocarp of  coconut, Kaduru and mango fruits, the pericarp 
of guava fruit and in pear fruit and seed coat of coffee and dates.
Functions of sclerenchyma 
 ²Provide support to the plant body

Xylem vessel elements are cylindrical elongated cells. Xylem vessel element 
stack on top of the others and the cross walls are dissolved to form a continuous xylem vessel. This tubular structure helps in transportation of water in plants. 
Tracheids  are elongated, spindle shaped cells. They also help in transportation 
of water. Xylem fibers are narrower and shorter than tracheids. Xylem vessels,

9tracheids and xylem fibers become dead due to lignification of cell walls. They 
provide support to the xylem tissue. Xylem parenchyma are living cells with a 
thin cell wall. They involve in food storage. 
Functions of xylem
 ²Transportation of water and minerals to the plant body which are absorbed 
by plant roots.
 ²Providing of mechanical support to plant body.

Phloem tissue is composed of four different  types of cells.
 ²Sieve tube elements
 ²Companion cells
 ²Phloem fibres
 ²Phloem parenchyma
The sieve tube elements fuse end to end and the cross walls are incompletely dissolved to form a sieve tube. The cross walls in these sieve tubes are called sieve plates. Sieve tubes transport food (mainly sucrose) throughout the plant, as a solution.
Companion cells are  elongated cells associated with sieve tube elements. The 
nucleus of the companion cell controls the activities of the sieve tube elements (sieve tube elements lack a nucleus). Sieve tube elements, companion cells and phloem parenchyma are living cells whereas phloem fibres are dead and found scattered in phloem tissue.
Functions of phloem tissueThe food synthesized in the leaves are transported throughout the plant body by this 
tissue (Translocation).

 ²A  nerve supply is present within the tissue but there is no blood supply
The epithelial tissue is classified according to the shape of the cell and the number of cell layers.
Examples for  several locations of epithelial tissues are given below.
 ²Wall of blood capillaries 
 ²Thyroid gland
 ²Lining of nasal cavity 
 ²Wall of urinary bladder
 ²Skin (Epidermis)
Functions of epithelial tissue
 ²Lining up of free surfaces and protection - Protects the internal organs from 
pressure, friction and microbes
 ²Absorptive function - The epithelium of digestive tract absorbs digestive end products
 ²Perception of stimuli - The epithelium of tongue and nose, detect taste and smell senses
 ²Secretory function - Secretion of mucous by the lining epithelium of respiratory tract
 ²Filtering function - Epithelium of Bowman's capsule in nephrons, filters blood

Figure 1.16 - Different Connective tissue present in 
human armBlood       
Connective tissue is composed of 
different types of cells and fibres. These cells and fibres are embedded in a large matrix.
Most connective tissues
possess nerve and blood supply.
The connective tissues provide connection between tissues and organs and provide support too. E.g. :- Blood tissue, Bone tissue
Blood tissue
Blood is a special connective tissue. The speciality is that the matrix (plasma) is not secreted by the blood cells. Blood tissue helps in maintaining proper connection between organs and tissue of the human body. 
Features of blood tissue
Figure 1.17 - Blood tissue ²Blood is composed of a fluid matrix. Matrix 
 is called plasma
 ²The matrix contains cells called red 
 blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood  cells (leucocytes) and cellular fragments  called platelets
 ²Fibres are not found always but during 
 blood clotting they appear
Functions of blood tissue
² Transportation of materials  -  Respiratory gases, nutrients, excretory materials and hormones are transported to the relevant organs 
² Protection                             -  White blood cells destroy foreign bodies (Microbes) by phagocytosis and by producing antibodies
² Maintenance of homeostasis

131.2.3 Muscle tissue
Muscle tissue is one of the main tissues that makes up the human body. Muscle tissue 
is made up of muscle cells or muscle fibres. These muscle fibres possess contraction and relaxation ability. Not like epithelial tissue, the muscle tissue possesses a good blood supply. Therefore muscle tissue receives oxygen and nutrients at a high rate. Muscle tissue acts as one of the effectors in responding in coordination.
Muscle tissue is of three types,
 ²Smooth muscle tissue
 ²Skeletal muscle tissue
 ²Cardiac muscle tissue
Compare the characteristics of different muscle tissues.Assignment 1.2
Smooth muscle  tissue
Smooth muscle tissue is made up of smooth muscle cells. This tissue is

It is an important tissue found in chordates body. The structural unit of nervous tissue is nerve cell or neuron. Neurons are specialised to transmit impulses.
Features of neuron
 ²Neuron is composed of two parts. They are cell body and nerve fibres.
 ²Nucleus, mitochondria, golgi body and endoplasmic reticulum are found in 
the cell body. 
 ²Axon arises from the cell body as a single process. The axon transmits impulses away from the cell body.
 ²Slender process called dendrites receive stimuli and transmit impulses to the cell body.
 ²Most of the axons in chordates are  myelinated. Myelin sheath is not continuous and the interrupted places are known as nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath increases the speed of transmission of impulses.
Functions of neurons
The function of the neuron is to receive the information from the receptors (eye, ear, 
nose, tongue, skin) or another neuron and to transmit them to the effector (muscles) or to another neuron.
According to the function of the neuron, they can be divided into three types as 
follows (Figure 1.22).
 ²Sensory  neuron
 ²Inter neuron
 ²Motor neuron

Sensory neuron
The cell body of the sensory  neuron is present at the middle of the nerve fibers. 
The cell bodies are present inside ganglion. The dendrites are present at the sensory  organs and the axon is present in the central nervous system. Ganglion is a structure formed by the collection of cell bodies. They transmit impulses from sensory organs to the central nervous system.
Motor neuron
A motor neuron possesses a star shaped cell body with many fibres. One of 
them is the axon and it is long. Sometimes it is greater than 1m in length. The other fibres and cell body are found within the central nervous system.
The function of the motor neuron is to transmit impulses from central nervous 
system to effector (muscles).
Inter neuron
The whole neuron is present within the central nervous system. The axons are 
short. Many dendrites are present. 
The inter neuron connects the sensory neuron with motor neuron.

ways. Using the knowledge about modes of nutrition of living beings, try to do the assignment 2.1.

 ²State their modes of nutrition Assignment - 2.1
As you know the food of cow and stork, you can state easily how the cow and the stork obtain their food. They depend on other organisms for their food. It is known as heterotrophic mode of nutrition.
How do green plants obtain their nutrition? These plants produce their food within 
them. Therefore, it is called autotrophic mode of nutrition. Living organisms depend 
on that food directly or indirectly for their existence.

Figure. 2.2 - Factors necessary for photosynthesis and its products
Utilizing the light energy the cells containing chlorophyll in green plants 
synthesize food using carbondioxide and water as raw materials. This process 
is called photosynthesis.
2.1 Factors that affect photosynthesis
Let us study how green  plants obtain water and carbondioxide for photosynthesis. 
Terrestrial plants obtain water from soil for photosynthesis. Water in the soil is absorbed through root hairs by osmosis. The absorbed water then travels into root xylem through cortex and endodermis. From there water is transported into mesophyll cells of leaves via the xylem of stem and the veins of leaves. The network of veins in the leaves distributes water throughout the leaf.
CO
2 is obtained from the atmosphere for photosynthesis. CO2 diffuses into leaf 
through stomata. Then it reaches the mesophyll cells via inter cellular spaces.

2.2 Products of photosynthesis
The glucose (C6 H12O6 ) produced during photosynthesis will be temporarily stored 
in leaves as starch. Later, part of that starch is converted into sucrose  (C12H22O11) 
and transport into other tissues, via phloem. The sucrose that is transported to storing organs are again stored as starch.
E.g :-- Fruits, Vegetables, Yams, Leaves, RootsThe byproduct of photosynthesis is O
2 and it is diffused into the atmosphere through 
stomata.
Prepare a report on adaptations shown by plants to absorb light energy from 
sunlight efficiently for photosynthesis.Assignment - 2.2
Photosynthesis can be expressed by a word equation as given below.
Carbon dioxide  ¬ Water    Light energy

     + 6O2 (g)

Plants absorb red and blue light of sunlight during photosynthesis.
Glucose produced during photosynthesis is stored temporarily in leaves as starch. Therefore it could be tested whether the photosynthesis has taken place or not by doing a test for starch.

23Carry out the activity 2.2 to identify starch produced during photosynthesis.
Materials required :- Beaker, Test tube, Tripod, Bunsen burner, Water, 
Alcohol, Plant leaf
Method :-- • Pluck a leaf from  a plant which was in sunlight and boil it in water.
 • Place that leaf in  the boiling tube with alcohol and boil the tube 
in a water bath for few minutes.
 • Next wash the leaf and put few drops of iodine solution onto it 
and observe the colour change.
Figure. 2.4 Leaf boiled

Water bath
LeafWater   Activity - 2.2
As chlorophyll dissolve in alcohol, the leaf is boiled in an alcohol solution. Then the solution becomes green in colour and leaf turns to pale colour. As alcohol is highly inflammable, it is boiled in a water bath.  
If the leaf turns to blue or dark purple, once iodine is added, we can conclude that 
starch is present in the leaf. 
Testing of factors required for photosynthesis
The plant should be kept in dark for 48 hours before the experiment to show that 
light energy and carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis. When the plant is in the dark the stored starch completely removes from the leaves.

The covered area of leaf A has not received light energy. Therefore photosynthesis 
has not taken place. Hence, there was no colour change with iodine solution. The covered area of leaf B with colourless polythene has received light energy. Therefore photosynthesis has taken place and showed a colour change to dark purple or blue indicating starch has been produced.
Accordingly, we can conclude that light energy is necessary for photosynthesis.

You can observe that there is no colour change in leaf D and there is a colour 
change in leaf C after adding iodine solution.

KOH present in bag D absorbs C O2. Therefore leaf D does not do photosynthesis 
as it does not receive CO2. Therefore there is no colour change.
Leaf C receives C O2, so it photosynthesises. Therefore a colour change can be 
observed. Leaf D has not produced starch but leaf C has produced starch.
Accordingly it can be concluded that CO2 is necessary for photosynthesis.

The white colour regions lack chlorophyll, so photosynthesis has not taken place. Therefore starch has not been produced. So it can be concluded that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.
An experiment cannot be designed in the laboratory to test the need of water for 
photosynthesis, because without water, the plant in the control experiment will die. 
Scientists have shown the need of water for photosynthesis using water with   O
818

needed for photosynthesis.

 th of its volume, the tube 
will be taken out and a glowing splinter is inserted to test whether the gas is oxygen.
The splinter will burn with a bright flame. So we can conclude that the gas given

282.3 Importance of photosynthesis
 ²Light energy is converted to chemical energy during photosynthesis. Plants 
produce food and all organisms live on earth depend directly or indirectly on that food. Photosynthesis cannot be done artificially. Therefore this process carried out by green plants is essential for the maintenance of life on earth
 ²The oxygen gas  which is required for the survival of  aerobic organisms and combustion of materials is released mainly by photosynthesis
 ²Carbondioxide that is accumulated due to respiration and combustion is removed from the environment by photosynthesis. Thereby it helps to maintain O
2 and CO2 balance in the atmosphere
 ²Photosynthesis helps to maintain the carbon cycle
 ²Light energy is converted into chemical energy by green plants during photosynthesis.
 ²Light energy, water, CO
2 and chlorophyll are required for photosynthesis.
 ²The main product of photosynthesis is glucose and oxygen is produced as a byproduct.
 ²Photosynthesis can be expressed by a balanced equation as below.

Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 303.1 Types of mixtures
Let us pay our attention to the composition of the air around us. Air is composed 
of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and very small particles such as dust. So, you may understand that air is a mixture of several substances.
Therefore, if some matter contains  two or more substances, such matter is referred 
to as mixtures. You have already learnt that elements and compounds are pure substances. But, mixtures are not pure substances. Natural environment mostly contains mixtures, not pure substances. Air, soil, sea water, river water and rocks around us are examples. The things that we drink such as cool drinks, fruit drinks, tea, coffee and food items such as ice cream, yoghurt and fruit salad are also mixtures. Let us do the following activity to study more about the components of a mixture.
Activity 3.1.1
Materials required: -  Hydrated copper sulphate, naphthalene (moth balls), mortar  
                   and  pestle
Method: - Take some copper sulphate and naphthalene (moth balls) into a mortar, 
grind them together with the pestle into a powder and mix well. Transfer the 
powder onto a piece of paper and observe.
At a glance, you may not be able to see two substances, copper sulphate and naphthalene but, you have a mixture of  the two. A blend of two or more pure substances is called a mixture and individual substances that form the mixture are known as components.
Activity 3.1.2
Materials required :- Two beakers, a glass rod, a funnel, a filter paper, hand lens.
Method :- Transfer the mixture made in activity 3.1.1 above into a small 100 ml 
beaker, add about 50 ml of water to it and stir well. Then, place a filter paper in a 
glass funnel and filter this solution into another beaker. Allow the residue on the filter paper to dry and observe with a hand lens. Observe the filtrate as well.MixturesChemistry

Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 31From this activity, you would have understood that the residue on the filter paper 
is naphthalene powder. Since the solution is blue in colour, the substance that dissolved in water is copper sulphate.
The above activity clarifies another feature of a mixture. That is, even when the 
components are in a state of being mixed, their chemical nature remains unchanged. In other words, the identity of the components constituting a mixture does not change even in the mixture. Moreover, the above activity shows that the components in a mixture can be separated by physical methods.
How the components in a mixture can be separated by physical methods will be 
discussed under the sub unit 3.3.
Thus mixtures can be defined as follows: Mixtures are matter consisting of two 
or more components which are not chemically combined, and can be separated 
by physical methods.
Table 3.1.1 shows the components of some commonly known mixtures.
Table 3.1.1
Mixture Components
Cement mortar Sand, cement, water
Cake Sugar, flour, water, colouring, butter
Well water Water, dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbondioxide 
and various salts.
Sea water Water dissolved oxygen and salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulphate, calcium sulphate
When considering mixtures, it is very important that how well the components are mixed. Understand this thoroughly with the help of the following examples.
Ex:- 1. When making colours by mixing paints, application of the paint will not 
   give a uniform colour unless they are mixed well.
         2.  If the components used to make cake are not mixed well, different parts of 
    the cake taste differently. Also, the rising will be different in different parts.
          3.  The medicinal property of tablets, capsules or liquid mixtures is not even in 
    
 all the parts if the components are not mixed well when producing medicines.
Investigate into more instances like the above examples.
Let us do activities 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 to study how the components are distributed in 
a mixture.

The above activity leads to the following conclusions. In the mixture formed by dissolving clay in water,
 ²The colour/transparency is different from place to place.
 ²The amount of clay particles in a unit volume is different from place to place.
Activity 3.1.4
Materials required :- A beaker, water, common salt, a piece of cloth
Method :- Take about 250 ml of water into a beaker. Add about 10 g of pure salt 
into it, stir till the salt dissolves and filter the solution with a piece of cloth. Allow 
to stand still for about one hour and see whether the clearness of the solution is equal from top to bottom. Repeat what you did in activity 3.1.2 for this solution as well.
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 33Following conclusions can be drawn from the above activity. In the mixture formed 
by dissolving salt in water,
 ²The transparency is equal throughout the solution.
 ²The amount of salt particles in a unit volume of the solution is equal throughout  the solution.
Pay your attention again to the mixtures you studied in activities 3.1.3 and 3.1.4. According to the nature of the distribution of components, mixtures can be divided into two categories.
 ²Mixtures in which the composition of the components is uniform throughout the mixture.
Ex: mixture prepared by dissolving common salt in water.
 ²Mixtures in which the composition of the components is not uniform throughout the mixture.
Ex: mixture prepared by dissolving clay in water
The mixtures in which the components are separated from one another are called 
heterogeneous mixtures. The mixtures whose composition of the components are uniformly distributed throughout are known as homogenous mixtures.
Homogeneous mixtures
The mixtures in which the components cannot be observed separately from one another and the properties and composition are similar throughout are termed homogenous mixtures. In a homogeneous mixture, the physical properties such as colour, transparency and density are identical everywhere. Homogenous mixtures are also known as solutions.    
Examples: salt solution, sugar solution 
Heterogeneous mixtures
The mixtures in which the components can be distinguished from one another and 
they are known as heterogeneous mixtures. The physical properties of the mixture 
such as colour, transparency and density are different from place to place, in a heterogeneous solution.

Prepare a list of mixtures used in various occasions in the laboratory and day-
to-day life. State the components in those mixtures. Differentiate them as homogeneous and heterogeneous. Indicate how those mixtures can be named according to the state in which the components exist.   
Solute and solvent of a solution
It was mentioned that a homogenous mixture is also called a solution. A solution is composed of a solvent and one or more solutes. Of the components mixed to form the solution, the component present in excess is the solvent. The rest of the components are solutes. 
Hence, it can be represented as,
Solute     +        Solvent       =       Solution
This can be further understood by paying attention to the solutions used in 
day-to-day life.
Ex: Salt  +  Water =  Salt solutionCopper sulphate  +  Water  =  Copper sulphate solutionSugar  +  Water  =  Sugar solution
 ²Solubility of a solute
What will happen if a small amount of a given solute is added to a solvent? It will 
dissolve and disappear.
What quantity of a solute can be dissolved like this in a given volume of the solvent? 
Do the following activity to find it out.
Activity 3.1.6
Materials required :- A beaker, salt, a glass rod
Method :- Measure 100 ml of water into a clean beaker. Weigh 100 g of pure 
salt (NaCl). Add salt, little at a time into the beaker of water and stir with the glass rod to dissolve it. Do not add more salt until the salt added before dissolves completely. When no more salt dissolves, stop adding more salt and weigh the remaining amount of salt. Approximately, what is the maximum mass of salt that can be dissolved in 100 ml of water?
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 36Is the amount of other components that dissolve in the same volume of water, the 
same? To investigate this, conduct the following activity.
Activity 3.1.7
Materials required  :- A beaker, calcium hydroxide, a glass rod
Method :- Weigh 10 g of calcium hydroxide at the laboratory. Take 100 ml of 
water to a beaker and dissolve calcium hydroxide in it, by adding a very small 
amount at a time while stirring. Stop the addition of solid when no more calcium hydroxide dissolves in the solution  and weigh the remaining solid. Approximately what is the maximum mass of calcium hydroxide that can be dissolved in 100 ml of water?
Compare the results of the activity 3.1.7 with those of 3.1.6
The above activities show that the quantity dissolved is more for some substances, 
while it is less for some other substances in the same volume of water.
Repeat activities 3.1.6 and 3.1.7 using 100 ml of hot water of about 80 
0C instead of 
water at room temperature. See whether the dissolved mass of the solute changes. 
It would be observed that a greater amount of the solute dissolves at a higher temperature than it does in an equal volume of water at room temperature.
In order to compare the dissolution of various solutes in a given solvent, the amount 
of solutes dissolved in the same volume of the same solvent at the same temperature should be compared. Therefore solubility is defined as follows.
The solubility of a solute at a given temperature can be defined as the mass 
of that solute which dissolves in 100 g of the solvent at a certain temperature.
Ex:- at 25 
0C, the solubility of magnesium chloride in water is 53.0 g.
At the same temperature, solubility of potassium sulphate in water is 12.0 g.
Factors affecting solubility
You have already identified temperature as a factor affecting the solubility of a 
solute in a given solvent. Try the following activities to investigate the other factors affecting solubility.
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 37Activity 3.1.8
Materials required :- Two small beakers, common salt, sugar
Method :- Take 50 ml of water at the same temperature into each of two small 
beakers. Accurately weigh 50 g each of salt and sugar. Adding a little at a time, 
dissolve salt in one beaker and sugar in the other. When it comes to the point beyond which no more solid dissolves, stop adding the substance and weigh the remaining solid. See whether the amounts left are equal.
You will be able to see that at the same temperature, different solutes dissolve in different amounts in equal volumes of the same solvent. Hence, it can be said that the nature of the solute affects the solubility.
Activity 3.1.9
Materials required  :- Two small beakers, kerosene, sugarMethod :- Take 50 ml each of the solvents water and kerosene at the same 
temperature into two small beakers. Add 5 g of sugar into each of them and stir. In which solvent does sugar dissolve?
You will be able to see that the sugar completely dissolves in water but sugar added 
to kerosene remains almost undissolved.
This shows that the solubility of the same solute is different in equal volumes of 
different solvents at the same temperature.
Therefore, it can be said that the nature of the solvent affects solubility.According to the observations of the above activities, it is confirmed that the 
following factors affect solubility.
1. Temperature2. Nature of the solute3. Nature of the solvent
Of the above factors, except temperature, the nature of the solute or the solvent 
are properties of matter. The characteristic properties of matter are imparted by the particles that make the matter. The nature of molecules which constitute the solute and solvent is a factor that determines the solubility. In grade 10, you have learnt about the polarity of a chemical bond. Based on the polarity chemical compounds can be classified into two categories; polar and non polar. At the same time, chemical compounds can also be classified into two types organic and inorganic -  according to the constituent elements of the compound.
Hence, solutes and solvents can be classified under four classes.
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 381. Polar organic solutes/solvents
2. Non - polar organic solutes/ solvents3. Polar inorganic solutes/solvents4. Non - polar inorganic solutes/solvents
From the following schematic diagram, you can identify the examples relevant to 
those four classes.

 ²Formalin
 ²Acetone ²Hexane
 ²Benzene
 ²Carbon 
      tetrachlorideNon-polar Non-polarInorganic 
 ²Water
 ²Ammonia
 ²Hydrogenchloride ²Carbon disulphide
 ²liquidCarbon dioxide
 
Based on the above classification, a general concept on solubility such as the one below can be composed.
Polar solutes are soluble in polar solvents
Ex  1  :- Ethanol is a polar compound. Water is a polar compound. Therefore, ethanol is soluble in water.
Ex 2 :- Ammonia is a polar compound. Water is a polar compound. Therefore, 
ammonia dissolves in water.
Non-Polar solutes are soluble in non-Polar solvents
Ex 1:- Grease is a non-polar solute. Kerosene is a non-polar solvent. Therefore, grease dissolves in kerosene.
Ex 2:- Jak glue (koholle) is a non-polar solute. Kerosene is a non-polar solvent. 
Therefore, jak glue is soluble in kerosene.
On that account, it can be concluded that solutes and solvents of similar 
polarity properties dissolve in each other (like dissolves like).

For free distribution 39 ²Solubility of a gas
Do gases really dissolve in water? Recall the following experiences to answer this.
 ²As soon as a bottle of soda water or a fizzy drink is opened, gas bubbles evolve 
from the solution.
 ²When a beaker of water is heated, gas bubbles can be seen on the walls of the beaker.
In both of these instances, it is the gases that were dissolved in water that got liberated. During the production of soda water, carbon dioxide gas is mixed with water under the special conditions of high pressure using machinery. Because of this more gas dissolves in water. However, atmospheric gases are always in contact with natural water. Then gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen dissolve only in small quantities.
When water is heated, the dissolved gases are evolved. Therefore, the amount of 
gases remaining dissolved in hot water is very small. Accordingly, temperature can be taken as a factor affecting the solubility of a gas.
Generally, the solubility of a solid substance in a solvent can be increased by 
increasing the temperature. But the solubility of a gas in a given solvent decreases with the rise in temperature. Are there any more factors affecting the solubility of a gas in water? See what conclusion could be drawn from the observations of the following activity.
Activity 3.1.10
Materials required  :- An unopened bottle of soda water (plastic), an empty                                        bottle of the same type.
          
Figure 3.1.3
Method :- Take an un opened bottle of soda water available in the market. To an 
identical empty bottle, add water equal in quantity to that of soda water and close the cap tightly. Now squeeze both bottles with hand and select the harder bottle. 
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 40You may feel that the unopened soda bottle is very hard that it cannot be pressed. 
Think why it is so. In the bottle of soda above the liquid, there is carbon dioxide gas under high pressure. The moment the cap is opened, carbon dioxide gas escapes, and the rigidity of the bottle is lost. When the pressure of a gas in contact with water is increased, the solubility of that gas in water too increases. Thus, the solubility of a gas in water depends on two factors.

3.2 Composition of a mixture
Activity 3.2.1
Materials required :-  Two beakers, potassium permanganateMethod :- Add 50 ml of water in each of to two beakers. Add 0.2 g and 0.4 g 
potassium permanganate separately to the two beakers and stir well with a glass rod. Record your observations.
You will be able to see, that the solution in the beaker with 0.2 g potassium permanganate is light purple in colour whereas the purple colour of the solution with 0.4 g potassium permanganate is relatively more intense.
When preparing the above two solutions, the volumes of water taken into the two 
beakers were equal. That means, the volumes of the solvent were equal. However, the masses of potassium permanganate used as the solute were different. In the solution with a more intense purple colour, a unit volume contains more solute particles. Therefore, the composition of these two solutions is different.
When preparing mixtures of weedicides and insecticides, they must be prepared 
in correct composition. Prescribed composition should be used when preparing solutions using pharmaceuticals. Laboratory work often involve the preparation of solutions of fixed composition. Therefore, understanding about the composition of mixtures is very important in everyday life as well as in laboratory experiments. There are several ways to express the composition of a mixture. Some of those are discussed in the following sections.Pressurised CO2 gas

For free distribution 413.2.1 Composition of a mixture as a mass fraction (m/m)
Let us consider a mixture comprising of two components A and B. The mass fraction 
of A in that mixture can be expressed as follows.
Mass fraction of A in the mixture    =           Mass of A
Mass of A + Mass of B
Hence, the mass fraction of a given component of a mixture is the ratio of the mass 
of that component to the total mass of the mixture.
Worked examples :-
1) 100 g of the solution contains 5 g of a solute. Give the composition of the solute 
of this mixture as a mass fraction.
Mass fraction of the solute     =    Mass of the solute
         =   5 g

2) When 250 g of a salt (NaCl) solution was weighed accurately and all the water 
in it was evaporated, 10 g of salt was left. Indicate the composition of salt in the solution as a mass fraction.

For free distribution 423.2.2 Composition of a mixture as a volume fraction (V/V)
V olume fraction is used to indicate the composition of a mixture when both of its 
components exist either in the liquid state or in the gaseous state.
In a mixture containing two components A and B, the volume fraction of  A can be 
given as follows.
V olume fraction of A =         V olume of A
                            Total volume of the mixture of A and B
Accordingly, the volume fraction of a given component of a mixture is the ratio of the volume of that component to the total volume of the mixture.
Worked examples:- 
1) A solution of final volume 250 cm
3 was made by adding distilled water to 
25 cm3  of ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH). What is the volume fraction of ethyl alcohol in 
this solution?
V olume fraction of ethyl alcohol =     V olume of ethyl alcohol
     =    25 cm3
 250 cm3
     = 1/10
     = 0.1Total volume of the solution
2) How do you prepare 500 cm3 of an aqueous solution of acetic acid of composition 
1/25 (V/V) ?
V olume fraction of acetic acid     =   V olume of acetic acid
V olume of acetic acid       =    V olume fraction of acetic acid  x   Final volume 
                   of the solution

by measuring 20 cm3 of acetic acid accurately and adding water to make the final 
volume up to 500 cm3.
3.2.3   The composition of a mixture as a mole fraction
The mole fraction of each component of a mixture containing only two component A and B can be expressed as follows.
Mole fraction of A =                           Amount of moles of A                                   Amount of moles of A + Amount of moles of B
Mole fraction of B =                           Amount of moles of B                                   Amount of moles of A + Amount of moles of B
Thus, the mole fraction of a component of a mixture is, the ratio of the amount of moles of that component to the total amount of moles of all the components in the mixture.
Worked examples :-
1) What is the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a solution made by 
dissolving 40 g of sodium hydroxide in 180 g of water?
Molar mass of water    =  (1 x 2 + 16) g mol 
-1
      =  18  g mol-1 
Amount of moles of water in the solution  =   180 g
 18  g mol-1  
      =  10 mol
Molar mass of sodium hydroxide  =  (23+16+1) g mol-1
       =  40 g mol-1 
Amount of moles of sodium hydroxide
in the solution     =   40 g
 40  g mol-1  
       = 1 mol
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 44Mole fraction of sodium 
hydroxide in the solution    =  
 Amount of moles of sodium hydroxide
Amount of moles of water + Amount of moles of  
     sodium hydroxide
          =    1
     10 + 1 
          =    1
 11 
Similarly, the mole fraction of water in the above solution can be calculated.
Mole fraction of water       =
  Amount of moles of water
Amount of moles  + Amount of moles of
   of water     sodium hydroxide
        =    10
   10 + 1 
       =   10
 11 
Sum of mole fractions     =  Mole fraction of water + Mole fraction of sodium   
                      hydroxide
       =    10
 11  +   1
 11  
       =     11
 11 
       = 1
The sum of mole fractions of all the components in a mixture is one. The sum of mass fractions or volume fractions of all the components in a mixture is equal to one. There are no units for the mass fractions, volume fractions or mole fractions of a mixture.
The composition of a mixture expressed as a fraction can also be expressed as a 
percentage or as parts per million (ppm).
Composition as a percentage   = Fraction  x 100
Composition as parts per million (ppm)  = fraction  x  1 000 000

   20 g     = 0.6
Magnesium carbonate composition as a percentage   = 0.6 x 100  = 60%

3.2.5  Expressing composition of a mixture in terms of amount of   
          moles / volume (n/v) 
This is used to express the composition of a homogeneous mixture (solution). 'Mole' 
is the international unit for the amount of matter. Here, the composition is given in terms of the amount of moles of solute contained in unit volume of a solution. The composition expressed in this way is called the concentration (C). In chemistry, very often concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of the amount of moles of solute contained in a cubic decimetre of the solution.

For free distribution 52The concentration of a solution can be lowered by adding more solvent to it. 
Decreasing the concentration by adding more solvent is known as dilution. Most of the acids in laboratory stores are concentrated acids. Mostly the acid solutions prepared by diluting those concentrated acids are used for laboratory experiments.
For your attention
As a safety measure, when diluting concentrated solutions, always 
the acid should be added to water. It is because the dilution of concentrated acids is highly exothermic and may be dangerous.
When n moles of a solute are dissolved in a solution of volume V, its concentration 
C can also be found using the following equation.
C = n
V
When n is in moles (mol) and V is in cubic decimetres (dm-3), concentration C is 
given in moles per cubic decimetre (mol dm-3)
Using the above equation, solve the previously studied worked examples to calculate the concentration.
3.3 Separation of compounds in mixtures
Many substances essential for our daily affairs are available in the Earth's crust. Metals, mineral oils, salts, sand, clay, coal, minerals and rocks are some of them. These rarely exist in pure form in the Earth's crust. Naturally they occur mixed with other substances. Therefore, the essential components should be separated from those mixtures.
Some instances where components from mixtures should be separated, are given 
below.

about several methods of separating components in mixtures.
3.3.1  Mechanical separation
You know that rice is sifted to remove the sand mixed with it. In this, sand is removed 
from rice based on the difference of the densities of the components. The separation of components in a mixture using the difference of their physical properties such as density, particle size, particle shape, magnetic properties and electric properties is called mechanical separation. Study the examples given in table 3.3.1 and have a further understanding about mechanical separations.

For free distribution 543.3.2 Vapourisation/Evaporation
You may have observed the extraction of salt from sea water. What happens here is 
that the water evaporates due to solar heat. Water gets evaporated and the dissolved salts get precipitated. During vapourization, the unnecessary components are 
vaporized by supplying heat to a mixture and the essential component is isolated.
When metals are dissolved in mercury a special solution known as an amalgam is 
formed.
When impure gold is dissolved in mercury, a solution of pure gold is obtained. 
This is known as the gold amalgam. When gold amalgam is heated,  mercury is evaporated and the pure gold is remained. The evaporated mercury is cooled and used again.
3.3.3 Filtration
Have you seen adding coconut milk to some curries when they are cooked at home? How is coconut milk made? Water is added to the coconut scraped by a coconut scraper, and then crushed and squeezed by hand. Parts of the white liming remain suspended in water without going into the solution. When the stuff is put into a milk-strainer the milky solution filters off leaving the pieces of solid coconut in the strainer.
Filtration can be used to separate from a mixture, the components that remain 
suspended in a liquid without going into the solution. A filter is required to filter a mixture. Milk-strainer is such a device. The filter paper used in laboratories is another such filter. Water purifying plants have sand filters. 
A filter has small holes. Particles smaller than the holes can pass through. But 
particles larger than those holes cannot pass through them. This is the concept used in filtration. In filtration, the substance left in the filter is called the residue while the solution that gets filtered is known as the filtrate.

Method :- Mix well, about 10 g of dry soil and about 5 g of salt (NaCl). Take

the apparatus as shown in figure 3.3.1 and filter. After filtration is over, observe the filter paper. Add about 10 cm
3 of the filtrate to an evaporating dish and vaporize. 
See whether there is anything left in the dish.
Large clay particles in the sample of soil do not pass through the filter, and they are held back by the filter paper. Since water and salt are made up of smaller particles, they pass through the filter and get into the filtrate.
3.3.4 Crystallisation
Let us consider instances where a solid dissolves in a solvent to form a homogeneous 
mixture. At a certain temperature, there is a maximum concentration of a substance that stays dissolved in a solution. Such solutions are said to be saturated with that substance.
If this saturated solution is vaporized, the concentration of that substance in 
the solution increases further. When the concentration of the solute exceeds the maximum possible concentration in the solution, the solute separates out forming crystals. 
Crystallization is thus the method of separating solid substances by concentration 
when a solute that can turn into a solid is present in a solution.
Manufacturing of sugar is an industry that utilities crystallization. Stems of 
Sugarcane are crushed and squeezed and the juice is purified. Its concentration is increased by vaporisation. Then, sugar separates out from the juicy solution as 
crystals.

For free distribution 56Production of salt from sea water is another industry that adopts crystallization. 
During the production of salt in salterns, several salts that are dissolved in sea water get crystallized.
Assignment 3.3.2
Obtain salt by the vaporisation or evaporation of a concentrated salt solution.
3.3.5 Recrystallization 
Recrystallization  is used to separate pure substances from solid, crystalline substances carrying impurities. The process of dissolving a solid, crystalline substance and turning it again into crystals is called recrystallization. Crystals of high quality without impurities can be obtained by recrystallization. 
In recrystallization, the impure solid is dissolved in the hot solvent till it becomes 
saturated. Afterwards, to separate the impurities in the impure solid, above solution is filtered while it is still hot. Pure crystals of the solid is obtained by cooling the filtrate. Here, crystallization occurs because the cold solution is saturated with the solute although the hot solution is not. The soluble components present as impurities in minor quantities are not crystallized as the solution is not saturated in them.
Activity 3.3.2
Take about 50 g of common salt available in the market. Take about 50 cm3 of 
water at a temperature of about 90 0c, into a beaker and dissolve crystals of salt 
until the solution is saturated. Filter the solution while it is still hot, using filter paper. Take the filtrate into a beaker, place it in a container of ice and shake slowly. Observe the crystals formed.
3.3.6 Solvent extraction
You have learnt that the nature of both solute and solvent affect solubility. Some solutes are soluble in large amounts in one solvent but dissolve in very small quantities in another solvent. For example, when solid iodine is added to water, a very small amount dissolves giving a light coloured solution. But a larger amount of iodine dissolves in solvents like carbon tetrachloride and cyclohexane.
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 57Aqueous solution of    
       iodine
Carbon tetrachloride
Figure 3.3.2
When carbon tetrachloride is added to an aqueous solution of iodine, they do not 
mix, and the layers get separated. After some time, it can be seen that the carbon tetrachloride layer turns violet while the aqueous layer becomes pale. What has happened here is the extraction of iodine from the aqueous layer into the carbon tetrachloride layer in which it is more soluble. The specialty here is the adequacy of a small volume of carbon tetrachloride to extract the iodine from a large volume of aqueous solution. 
After this, iodine can be recovered by separating layers and evaporating carbon 
tetrachloride.
Hence, solvent extraction is the method of drawing up a substance from a solvent in 
which it is less soluble, into another solvent in which it is more soluble, where the two solvents are immiscible and are in contact with each other.
The medicinal components in some plants are found only in trace amounts. 
Medicinal solutions of higher concentration are prepared using solvent such as ethanol. Solvents extraction is used in the production of medicinal extracts and potions.
3.3.7 Simple distillation, fractional distillation and steam distillation
The separation of components by boiling a solution or a mixture and condensing the vapour is called distillation.
So, there must be a mechanism to cool the distillate or the vapour that evolves 
when a given mixture is heated. The Liebig condenser in the school laboratory is an

cold water is circulated around it, in order to cool down the vapour. This condenser has an inlet and an outlet for water.

Assignment 3.3.3
Investigate into how an improvised liebig condenser can be made. Make such an apparatus, show it to the science teacher and find its merits and demerits.
 ²Simple distillation
Simple distillation is used to separate components in a mixture which contains 
a volatile component with other non-volatile components. Only the volatile components are vaporized during distillation. The other components are left in the solution. For example, let us assume that a sample of well water is subjected to distillation.
In addition to water, it contains various salts and some gases dissolved in it. When 
heated slightly, the gases escape without getting condensed. Boiling points of salts are higher than that of water. Therefore, when the sample of well water is heated and vaporized, only the water vaporizes. Salts can be seen deposited at the bottom of the container. For this kind of distillation, special control of conditions is not essential. Hence, this is known as simple distillation. For this use of simple equipment such 
as the liebig  condenser is adequate. The figure illustrates the apartments set up to 
obtain distilled water from a sample of well water. Some countries use this method to obtain potable water from sea water.

 ²Fractional distillation
If the solution or the mixture subjected to separation contains several volatile 
components, simple distillation or the apparatus used in simple distillation cannot be used to separate them. It has to be performed under controlled conditions and for it, a fractionating column should be used. If two liquids are to be separated by fractional distillation, there should be a  considerable difference in their boiling points. That means, their volatilities need to be considerably different. Here, the vapour contains a higher percentage of the more volatile component and a lower percentage of the less volatile component.
Let us assume that the boiling point of a component A mixture is 80 
0C and the 
boiling point of a component B is 40 0C. Upon heating, the mixture containing A 
and  B begins to boil at a temperature slightly above 40 0C. Therefore, the vapour 
formed is richer in component B. When this vapour is collected and condensed at 
a temperature closer to 40 0C, the resulting liquid contains more B. A is present 
in smaller amount. When more of B gets removed from the mixture like this, its percentage of A increases. Then, the temperature at which the mixture boils also 
increases. This way, the components can be separated by collecting the vapours at different temperatures and condensing them. Separation of several components by distillation under controlled cooling conditions like this, is known as fractional distillation.
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 60Crude oil is a mixture of many hydrocarbon components. When refining crude oil, 
a fractionating tower is used to control the cooling conditions. In this tower, the temperature is appropriately controlled at different levels and the components are separately withdrawn at the respective positions. Components with lower boiling points are separated from the upper levels of the tower. Components with high boiling points are (bitumen) deposited at the bottom of the tower. This can be further understood by studying figure 3.3.5.

Fractional distillation is also used to separate the components in atmospheric air. When air is pressurised and cooled to about - 200 
0C, it liquifies. This liquid 
is also a mixture of several components which vaporize at their boiling points. Likewise, nitrogen boils off at - 196 
0C whereas oxygen and carbon dioxide boil 
at - 183 0C and - 78.5 0C respectively.

We know that certain parts of plants contain volatile components. Cinnamon, 
clove, cymbopogon, nutmeg and cardamom are few such examples. It is difficult to increase the temperature uniformly up to the boiling point of these compounds. Moreover, at the temperatures close to the boiling point, there is a possibility of destruction of these compounds by decomposition or getting converted into other compounds. Therefore, heat is supplied to the mixture by steam.
When water soluble compounds are mixed with water, the boiling point of such 
mixtures are above the boiling point of water. On the other hand, when the compounds that do not mix well with water are together with water, the boiling point of the mixture drops below the boiling point of water.
Most of the essential oils are immiscible with water and their boiling points are 
greater than that of water. They occur in living cells, mixed with water. Extraction of essential oils can be demonstrated in the laboratory by using an apparatus such as the one given below.

When heat is supplied to these mixtures by steam, both water and the essential oil 
get liberated as a mixture of vapors at a temperature below the boiling point of water (100 
0C). When the distillate (vapour) is cooled it separates into two layers 
because water and the essential oil are immiscible. Therefore, they can be easily 
separated as pure substances.

3.3.8 Chromatography
Chromatography is used to separate and identify the components present in a mixture 
(solid or liquid) containing non-volatile components. There are many different types of chromatography. The method carried out using paper (cellulose) is known as paper chromatography.
Add a little amount of water to a petri dish and dip one end of a dry strip of a filter paper 
in it. It can be observed that a stream of water particles is soaked up the strip of paper from bottom to top. Even when water is replaced by compounds such as acetone, ether and ethyl alcohol, a flow of liquid which flows up from the bottom to top can be seen. The  strip of paper is called the stationary phase while the solvent that is soaked into it is called the mobile phase. When a small portion of the mixture whose components need to be separated is placed on this paper, the components in the mixture dissolve in the solvent and move up with the solvent front. This upward movement depends on the forces of attraction of the components of the mixture, to the stationary phase. For example, if one component in the mixture is strongly attracted to the stationary phase (the paper), its rate of upward movement decreases. If there is another component in the mixture that is relatively less attracted to the mixture, it moves up faster through the stationary phase. Because of this difference in the speed of movement of the components in the mixture, they get separated from one another. Let us do the following activity to 
separate out the components in a chlorophyll mixture using paper chromatography.

• Connect a piece of string to the end of the paper strip opposite to that with the chlorophyll drop.
• Add a solvent such as acetone/kerosene/petrol to the boiling tube and stopper it. Leave it to saturate. Connect a hook to the stopper as shown in the diagram and suspend the strip on the hook so that its other end dips in the solvent. Ensure that the sides of the strip do not touch the walls of the boiling tube.

be seen that the components of different colours are separated. This leads to the conclusion that chlorophyll contains different components.
Therefore, chromatographic technique can be used to separate and identify several 
components when they are mixed together. Chromatography is used to find whether poisonous  chemicals are mixed with water. It is also used to check whether harmful substances are associated with food items. Chromatographic technique is also useful in identifying active chemical compounds in plants.
Uses of separating techniques
Extraction of salt from sea water
In Sri Lanka salt  is produced by the evaporation of sea water in salterns. The sea 
water collected in the salt pans are concentrated by evaporation during which salt crystallizes out finally. The separating techniques evaporation and crystallization
are used in this method.
The location and structure of a saltern is very important in the production of salt. 
The geographical and environmental factors that should be taken into consideration when setting up a saltern are as follows.
1.A flat land situated closer to a coastal area to obtain sea water easily
2.Presence of a clayey soil with minimum percolation of water
3.Prevailence of dry and hot climate with bright sunlight and wind throughout 
    the year4.An area with minimum rainfall.
Regarding the structure of a saltern, three types of tanks can be identified.
Figure 3.3.9 A saltern ² Large, shallow tanks
 ² Medium tanks
 ² Small tanks
Chemistry Mixtures
For free distribution 65The main steps of the production of salt in a saltern are as follows.
Step 1 :- The sea water is either made to flood into the big, shallow tanks during 
high tide or is pumped into them and allowed to evaporate by sunlight. 
When the concentration is twice as double the initial concentration of sea water, calcium carbonate (CaCO
3) begins to crystallize and 
precipitate at the bottom of the first tank.
Step 2 :- This water is then transfered into the medium- sized tanks in which the 
water evaporates further. When the concentration of water is about four times the initial concentration, calcium sulphate (CaSO
4) crystallizes 
and settles down at the bottom.
Step 3 :- Following the precipitation of calcium sulphate, the solution is allowed 
to flow from the medium tanks into the smaller tanks in which water is evaporated further. When the concentration is nearly ten times the concentration of initial sea water, salt (NaCl) crystallizes and precipitates at the bottom.
While salt is precipitating, the concentration of the solution increases further. Even before the total precipitation of sodium chloride is complete, magnesium chloride (MgCl
2) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO4)  begin to precipitate. These give a bitter 
taste to salt. The solution left after the precipitation of salt is known as mother liquor or bittern.
Salt deposited in the third tank is taken out, heaped in prismatic piles at another 
place and stored for a period of six months. Pure sodium chloride is not hygroscopic. But if salt contains magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate, it becomes bitter and hygroscopic as well as deliquescent when exposed to the atmosphere. But, as magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate absorb moisture in the atmosphere and go into solution, with the elapse of about six months most of them get removed, salt is retained as a solid.
Extraction of essential oils
V olatile compounds obtained from plant materials are referred to as essential 
oils. The reason for the characteristic aroma of some plant materials are volatile compounds that they contain. Some main essential oils produced in our country are :

Essential oils, being mixed with water vapour, vapourises at a temperature below 100

they are immiscible, they can be obtained separately.
Assignment 3.3.5
Inquire into the traditional method of cinnamon oil  extraction in Sri Lanka and prepare a report.
Obtaining essential oils by solvent extraction
Solvent extraction is another method of extracting essential oils. Organic solvents such as ether, chloroform and toluene are used in this method. When plant parts are shaken with the solvent, essential oil dissolves in the solvent. The essential oil is separated by letting the solvent to vaporize.
V olatile oils in some plant parts can also be obtained by compressing them under a 
suitable pressure.
Summary
• Matter can be divided into two parts, pure substances and mixtures.
• In natural environment, pure substances are very rare and what is more abundant 
are mixtures.
• The substances formed by mixing two or more substances without any chemical changes are called mixtures. The physical and chemical properties of the components are retained even in the mixture. The components of a mixture can be separated by physical methods.
• A mixture is a homogeneous mixture when its components are uniformly distributed. If not, it is a heterogeneous mixture.
• A homogeneous mixture is also referred to as a solution. Characteristics such as concentration, colour, density and transparency of any minute part of a solution are identical. In heterogeneous mixtures these are different.
• In a solution the component present in a greater proportion is called the solvent and the component that is less in proportion is known as the solute.

• Dissolving of a solute in a solvent depends on temperature, polar characteristics 
related to the molecular properties of the solute and solvent as well as organic or inorganic nature.
• The solubility of a gas in water depends on the pressure of that gas over water  and temperature.
• Different notations are used to indicate the composition of a mixture. Mass fraction (m/m), volume fraction (V/V), mole fraction, mass-volume ratio (m/V) and mole-volume ration (n/V) are some of them.
• Among the different notations used, mole-volume ratio (n/V) is also known as the concentration. It has the units of mol dm
-3 (moles per cubic decimetre)
• Solutes of known composition need to be prepared for various tasks in day to day life. For this, various apparati are used in the laboratory.
• The components of mixtures are separated in everyday life as well as in industry. Various methods are used for it.
• During sifting, flatting and winnowing, components are separated by using the difference in density of the components. Sieving and filtration are carried out making use of the difference in size of the component particles.
• Components can be separated by vaporization due to the difference in their boiling points.
• The concentration of a solution is used in crystallization and recrystallization where the concentration is made to exceed the saturated concentration.
• Some substances have a higher solubility in one solvent and lower solubility in another.
• In solvent extraction, a solute dissolved in smaller quantity in one solvent is drawn into another solvent in which it is more soluble. For this, the two solvents must be immiscible.
• When separating components by distillation, the mixture is heated. The components, that vaporize at their boiling points get removed from the mixture and are collected at a different place by cooling.
• Depending on the differences of the techniques used and the properties of components,  distillation can be divided into three modes-simple distillation, fractional distillation and steam distillation.
• In paper chromatography, a stream of a volatile solvent is passed through a drop of a mixture placed on a special paper. In this, components are separated from one another because of the difference of speed with which they travel through the paper which in turn is caused by the differences in the strength of attraction of the components to the paper (cellulose).

Waves and their

You have seen the ripples formed when you drop a pebble onto a still water surface.  
The disturbance caused by the pebble spreads over the water surface in the form of circles centered around the point where the pebble hit the water surface as shown in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1 – Formation of ripples on a water surface.
If you hold a rope horizontally as shown in Figure 4.2, and then shake the rope up and down, you will observe ripples forming in the rope.  Here too the disturbance caused by the hand travels along the rope.
Figure 4.2 – Formation of ripples on a horizontal string
Such a disturbance propagating through a medium or space is known as a wave.
If you place an object like a plastic ball on the water surface and then disturb the water surface, how would the plastic ball move? 
You will observe that the plastic ball moves up and down perpendicular to the water 
surface.  In order for the ball to move up and down, energy must be transmitted to the ball.  Here, energy was transmitted to the ball through the water waves.
An important property of waves is that they carry energy from one point to another.  
This energy transmission takes place in a manner that does not transmit the substance of the medium between the points concerned.04
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 73As an example, when a water wave travels on a water surface, although the water 
particles at each point move up and down, the water particles do not travel along with the water wave.
●	Wave Motion
In the two examples given above, the waves propagate through a certain medium.  The medium in the case of water waves is water.  The medium in the case of waves propagating along the rope is the material of the rope.  The motion of the particles in each medium transmits energy in the form of waves through the medium even though the particles themselves do not travel along with the wave.  Apart from the two media mentioned above, waves propagate through many other media. 
We hear various sounds through sound waves propagating through air. Sound 
propagates not only through air but also through liquids and solids.
In addition to waves that travel through various media, there are waves traveling 
without a material medium. Light is an example for a wave that travels without a medium. Although there are regions between the sun and the earth without any material medium, the earth receives light and heat from the sun.  Light and heat  from the sun arrive at the earth as electromagnetic waves and a material medium is not required for the propagation of electromagnetic waves.    
Radio waves too are a form of electromagnetic waves. Radio programs transmitted by a radio transmission station reach the radio set in your home through air.  However, air is not required for radio transmissions.

Wave motion can be studied using a slinky. A slinky is a coil formed with a steel wire.  Figure 4.3 shows a slinky.

The wave propagating along this slinky is an example for a wave that needs a medium for propagation. Waves that need a material medium for propagation are known as mechanical waves. Waves formed on water surfaces, sound waves that 
travel in air, and waves formed on a guitar string when the string is plucked are some examples for mechanical waves.
For the propagation of mechanical waves, the participation of the particles in the 
medium is essential. Based on the direction of motion of the particles of the medium and the direction of propagation of the wave, mechanical waves can be divided into two categories.

Such waves that propagate in a direction perpendicular to the direction the particles of the medium move are called transverse waves. Therefore, this wave is a transverse wave.  
The water waves generated by disturbing a still water surface by dropping an object 
such as a pebble, water particles of the medium move up and down within a certain range while the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to that.

Compressions are formed when the slinky is pushed forward while rarefactions are formed when the free end is moved backward. As a result of this, a wave propagates along the slinky. By observing the motion of the ribbon you can see in which 
direction the parts of the spring move.
If the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave 
propagation, such waves are known as longitudinal waves. You will observe 
that the waves formed in the slinky in this activity are longitudinal waves.

4.1.3 Physical quantities associated with wave motion
Waves are disturbances that spread from one point to another. Therefore waves have 
variations that depend on both time and distance.  In the waves that we observe in nature, quite often these variations show complex forms.  However, in this lesson we will only consider waves of a very simple form known as sinusoidal waves.    
The graph in Figure 4.10 shows how the displacement from the central position of a particle taking part in the wave motion varies with time. 
Extra Knowledge
For example, at time t0 the displacement of that particle is zero. With time, the 
displacement of this particle increases and at time t1 it takes a maximum positive 
value. After that the displacement starts to decrease, becomes zero at time t2 and 
then increases in the negative direction. At time t3 it takes a maximum negative 
value and then becomes zero again at t4 . The motion of the particle from time 
t0 to t4 is called one oscillation. In addition to the word oscillation, the word 
vibration is also used to describe such motions. If this motion is slow, it is called an oscillation and if it is fast, it is called a vibration.
The graph in Figure 4.11 shows how the displacement from the central position of 
each particle along the travel path of the wave varies with the distance from the source to each of the particles.

The shape of a transverse wave that we see in a single moment, like the wave 
traveling	along	a	string	shown	in	figure	4.8,		is	the	same	as	the	shape	of	the	graph	of Figure 4.11 showing the variation of the displacement of the particles with the distance from the source at a given instance.  Because the particle displacement in longitudinal waves takes place in the same direction as the direction of wave propagation, we can not see the form of the graph in a similar manner as for transverse waves.  However, if we somehow measure and plot the variation of the displacement with distance we will obtain a graph like that shown in Figure 4.11.
With	the	help	of	these	graphs	we	can	define	some	physical	quantities	associated	
with waves. 
●	Amplitude of a Wave
The maximum displacement shown by the particles taking part in the wave motion is known as the amplitude of the wave. 
●	Wave length of a Wave
The distance between one particle and the closest next particle taking part in the wave motion having the same state of motion is known as the wavelength (λ) of 
the wave. As an example, a particle on a trough or a crest of the wave shown in Figure 4.10 has reached its maximum displacement. A particle on the next trough or crest also has the same state of motion. Therefore, the distance between these two particles, that is the distance between two consecutive troughs or crests is equal to the wavelength.
●	Period
The time taken by a particle for a complete oscillation is known as the period (T).  
The time taken by a wave to travel a distance equal to the wavelength is also equal 
to	theperiod.	(figure	4.10)

The number of oscillations carried out by a particle in a unit time is known as the 
frequency (f).  Frequency is equal to the reciprocal of the period.  The unit used to measure the frequency is known as Hertz (Hz)	and	one	Hertz	is	defined	as	one	oscillation per second.

●	Speed
A wave travels a distance equal to the wavelength ( λ) in a time interval equal to the 
period (T). Therefore its speed is given by v = λ/ T or  v = f λ.

4.2 Electromagnetic Waves
The figure shown here is a photograph of a radio 
telescope. The antenna of this telescope receives radio waves emitted at by very distant stars. Understanding the information contained in those waves helps us to understand more about the history of the universe. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves. Now let us consider more about electromagnetic waves. 
The participation of material particles of a medium is not required for the propagation 
of electromagnetic waves. While electromagnetic waves consist of electric fields and magnetic fields that oscillate in directions perpendicular to each other, the wave propagates in a direction perpendicular to the directions of both the electric and magnetic fields as shown in Figure 4.12. Therefore electromagnetic waves belong to the class of transverse waves.

All electromagnetic waves propagate with the speed of 2.988 × 108 ms-1 in a vacuum 
(It is often taken as 3 × 108 m s-1 in calculations). Speed of electromagnetic waves in 
material media is less than the speed in a vacuum and accordingly the wavelength 
also changes. For electromagnetic waves, the speed c is given by the relationship c = f	λ	where	f	is	the	frequency	and	λ	is	the	wavelength.
  
Characteristics of electromagnetic waves
 ²Electromagnetic waves are not affected by external electric or magnetic fields.
 ²They do not require a material medium for propagation.
 ²They travel at a speed of  3 × 108 m s-1 in a vacuum.  
4.2.1 Electromagnetic Spectrum
The characteristics of electromagnetic waves vary significantly in various frequency 
ranges. Various frequency ranges identified by such characteristics are known as the electromagnetic spectrum.  Main types of electromagnetic waves belonging to the electromagnetic spectrum are listed in the table below.

² Visible Light
Visible light is the range of the electromagnetic spectrum to which our eyes are 
sensitive.  It is only a narrow band in the electromagnetic spectrum.  The frequencies 
of the visible light range from 4.28 × 1014 Hz to 7.69 × 1014 Hz corresponding to 
a wavelength range from 690 nm to 400 nm.  The region containing the lowest wavelength (highest frequency) in this range appears violet to the human eye.  When the wavelength increases (frequency decreases) gradually the color changes to indigo, blue up to red.  These are the colors that we identify as the seven colors in the rainbow.
² Gamma rays           
Figure 4.14 – An instance where gamma rays 
are used
Gamma rays are a type of waves emitted by radioactive elements.  Frequencies of gamma rays are extremely high and so are the energies possessed by them.  Gamma rays have the ability even to penetrate thick sheets of steel as well as concrete slabs.  Since gamma rays can destroy living cells they are used to destroy cancer cells. 
Gamma rays are also used to sterilize utensils used for food and surgical instruments.
² X-rays
X–rays are mostly used to take photographs of internal organs of the human body.  
Although X-rays travel quite easily through the soft tissues in the body, their intensity decreases rapidly when traveling through the bones of the body.  When the X–ray generator is turned on, X–rays propagate through the relevant part of the body of the person being photographed and thus forms an image of that part of the body.  Excessive exposure to X–rays can cause cancers.                                                       
Figure 4.15 – X-ray imagingX–rays are generated by bombarding high 
speed electrons on metal targets.  Then part of the kinetic energy of the electrons gets converted to X–rays.
X–rays are also used to examine the baggage of 
airline passengers and cargo inside containers transported by ships, without opening them. 
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 84 Extra knowledge
X - rays are generated by allowing a fast beam of electrons to hit a metal target.
A part of the kinetic energy of the electrons is then converted to X-rays.
² Ultraviolet radiation 
Ultraviolet means ‘above violet’.  Violet is the color having the highest frequency 
out of the seven colors that form the visible spectrum.  Ultraviolet radiation is a type of rays having a frequency range above that of violet and is invisible to the human eye.  Although ultraviolet rays are invisible to the human eye, it has been found that insects like bees can detect ultraviolet rays.  Sunlight contains a small amount of ultraviolet rays.  Ultraviolet rays are also produced in electric discharge and from mercury vapor lamps.
Since these rays produce vitamin D in the human body, it is useful to be exposed 
to sunlight to some extent.  However, over exposure to ultraviolet rays can cause cataract in the eye and cancers in the skin.
                                   
Figure 4.16 – An instance of generating ultraviolet raysUltraviolet radiation is used in 
hospitals to kill germs.  Certain chemical substances show a glitter when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.  This phenomenon is used in places like banks to check hidden symbols in currency notes.  Such chemicals are also added to some washing powders.  Clothes washed with such washing powders show a brightness when exposed to sunlight.
² Infrared Radiation
The range of frequencies below the red color that is not visible to us is known as  
infrared radiation.  Because infrared radiation is emitted by heated bodies and we feel a warm sensation when infrared radiation falls on our skin, infrared radiation is often referred to as heat rays. 
Physics  Waves and their Applications

too.  Heat photographs are taken with the

Infrared radiation is used to send signals to television sets from remote controls.  
Most of the cameras in mobile telephones and computers are sensitive to infrared radiation. Infrared radiation is also used for physiotherapy treatments.

² Microwaves
The range of frequencies below the infrared frequencies is known as microwaves.  
Microwaves are used in RADAR systems, mobile telephones and microwave ovens. 
 Extra knowledge
Water and fat in food have the ability to absorb microwaves and convert that 
energy into vibrational kinetic energy (heat).  This is the principle behind the operation of microwave ovens.
An instrument known as the magnetron is used to produce microwaves in microwave 
ovens and radar systems that need high power microwaves for their operation.  
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 86Microwaves too can cause adverse effects on our bodies.  Generally microwave 
ovens are produced so that microwaves do not leak out from the oven.  However as 
a precautionary measure it is better not to stay too close to microwave ovens when they are in operation.  It is suspected that the excessive use of mobile telephones can cause harm to the brain.

² Radio Waves
Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and the shortest frequencies of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. They are used in long distance communications.  Radio waves are produced using radio frequency oscillators. When radio waves fall on an aerial, it received the information carried by the wave. 
Antennas are used for transmitting and receiving radio waves. Information is 
transmitted through radio waves by modifying the amplitude or the frequency of a radio wave according to the information to be transmitted.

If you listen carefully to various sounds in your surroundings early in the morning, 
you would hear many sounds.  It is by listening that you would be able to enjoy when the musical instruments are played. The type of energy that produces the sensation of hearing in our ears is known as acoustic energy.
Figure 4.21 – Playing oriental music
Figure 4.22 – Hyla tree frog The type of frogs known as Hyla tree frog shown in	figure	4.22	is	found	in	South	America.		 They	
are capable of amplifying their voice using an inflatable	balloon	like	body	organ	under	their	throat. Only the male frog can generate this sound and their voice travels about ten time further than the sounds from other varieties of frogs. This sound is generated when the air dispelled by the 
balloon passes through two stretched membranes at the bottom of the mouths of the frogs giving rise to vibrations in the membranes. 
Many animals have the capability of producing sounds by vibrating an organ in their body. A buzzing bee makes sound waves by moving its wings to and fro repeatedly very fast.
Crickets make their sound by rubbing their wings 
together.
Not only animal sounds but, all sounds are generated by vibrations of objects.  
We hear those sounds when the resulting sound waves propagate through air and reach our ears. Our vocal cords vibrate, causing the air around them to vibrate and producing sound waves in the air.  
We will investigate the propagation of acoustic or sound waves, their characteristics 
and applications in this lesson.  
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 884.3.1 Propagation of Sound Waves
In order to understand how sound waves propagate in air, 
let us consider a sound wave generated by a loud-speaker.  Sound is generated by a loud-speaker when a membrane inside the loud-speaker is set into vibrations. 
Figure 4.23 (a) shows the distribution of air molecules 
can be seen in front of the loud speaker. when the membrane is not vibrating.
Suppose	that	the	membrane	starts	vibrating	by	first	moving	to	the	right.		 When	the	
membrane moves to the right the air molecules in front of it are pushed forward 
giving rise to a layer of compressed air as shown in Figure 4.23 (b).This compressed region moves forward with the kinetic energy transferred to the air molecules by the membrane.

(f)
When the membrane moves to the left, a region of rarefactions is formed in the air layer adjacent to it as shown in Figure 4.23 (c).  When the membrane moves to the right again, another layer of compressed air is formed which too moves to the right as shown in Figure 4.23 (d).
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 89The membrane alternatively generates compressions and rarefactions in the air, all 
of which travel forward with the same speed.  These compressions and rarefactions are known as sound waves.  Note that each air molecule only vibrates back and forth around a mean position although the compressions and rarefactions move forward. Sound is longitudinal waves. 
Figure 4.24 - Communication by whales 
using sound wavesSound propagates not only through air.  Sound propagates through water even faster than through air. That is why there are methods of communication through water. Whales use sound waves to communicate among themselves. 
Sound waves travel through water with 
a speed of about 1400 ms
-1.  Sound 
propagation is even better through solids. 
Speed of sound waves through steel is about 5000 m s
-1.  That is why the sound of 
a train approaching from a distance can be clearly heard through the steel rails.
                     
Figure 4.25 – Perception of sound by a snake 
through vibrations in the groundSnakes can detect vibrations in the ground through its lower jaw bone.  These vibrations are then transmitted to it through the bones.  This way, the snake hears the foot-steps of its prey.
Unlike light, a medium is essential 
for sound to spread. That means sound waves are mechanical waves. Therefore they do not travel through a vacuum.  The following simple experiment illustrates that sound does not travel through a vacuum.  
Physics  Waves and their Applications

As	shown	in	Figure	4.26,	an	electric	bell	is	fixed	inside	a	bell	jar	and	its	connecting	
wires are connected to a power supply and a switch outside the jar.  The bell jar is connected to a vacuum pump.  The vacuum pump can pump out the air from inside the jar.  After starting the ringing of the electric bell, the vacuum pump is turned on. You will observe that the sound of the electric bell becomes fainter gradually and finally	no	sound	is	heard.
The instance that the sound is no longer heard is when the interior of the bell jar 
becomes a vacuum.  When the vacuum pump is turned on, the air inside the bell jar is gradually removed and ultimately it becomes a vacuum.  This experiment illustrates that sound cannot propagate through a vacuum and that a medium is essential for sound waves to travel through. 
4.3.2 Speed of Sound
Figure 4.27 – Light is seen a short while before 
the sound of thunder from a lightning strikeWe hear the sound of thunder a short while after we see the light from a lightning strike taking place at a distant point.  We see the light emitted in a lightning strike when that light travels towards us and enters our eyes.  Light travels at the speed of 300 000 km s
-1 
(3 ×	108 m s-1).  Therefore it takes only 
a very short time for us to see the light from a lightning strike.  There is a short time gap between seeing the light and hearing the thunder because it takes a longer time for the sound wave to travel to our ear than it takes for the light to travel to our eyes from the point where the lightning strike took place.
The characteristics of waves discussed in section 4.1.3 are common to sound waves too.
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 91♦	The speed of sound at 0 oC in dry air is about 330 m s-1.  As the temperature 
increases, the speed of sound waves in air also increases.  The speed of sound 
at 30 oC in dry air is about 350 m s-1.
♦	The speed of sound in water is about 1400 m s-1.  This means that the speed of 
sound in water is about four times as the speed of sound in air.  The speed of sound through a steel rod is about 5000 m s
-1.
4.3.3 Characteristics of Sound
The sound of some musical instruments is of a high pitch. The sound emitted by the 
violin in soft. The sound of thunder caused by a lightning strike is loud. The above 
statements describe some characteristics of sound waves. 
Properties of sound that makes it possible to distinguish different sounds are called 
sound characteristics. That means, sound characteristics are the sensations produced in the ear that helps us to distinguish different sounds.
There are three main characteristics of sound.
 1' Pitch   2' Loudness 3' Quality of sound 
² Pitch

●	Clamp a hacksaw blade between two blocks of wood so that its free end  juts out about 10 cm.

●	Vibrate the blade and listen to the sound it generates.
●	Increase the length of the 
blade jutting out in steps of 5 cm at time listening to the sound emitted.  You will notice that the sharpness of the sound decreases gradually. 
●	Pitch is the quality of sound depends on by the physical quantity frequency.
Physics  Waves and their Applications
For free distribution 92 When the length of the free end of the blade is increased, the frequency of vibrations 
of the blade decreases gradually.  Accordingly, the pitch of the sound generated by the blade also decreases.  The pitch of the sound generated by an object increases when its frequency of vibration increases while the pitch of the sound decreases when its frequency of vibration decreases.  Out of the musical notes, the frequency of the note middle C is 256 Hz.  The frequency of the note higher C is 512 Hz.  Therefore the pitch of the higher C is twice as high as the pitch of the middle C.  
The oscillation of the air molecules around their central position when a sound wave travels in air can be observed using a cathode ray oscilloscope in the form of a graph plotted against time.  When a microphone is connected to an oscilloscope as shown in Figure 4.29, and strike a tuning fork on a rubber stopper to generate a sound, the oscilloscope screen displays the graph corresponding to the sound wave generated.  The shape of the graph displayed on the cathode ray oscilloscope is known as the wave form of the sound wave that gave rise to the graph.

² Loudness
Tap softly on a drum.  Next tap the drum with a larger force.  Study the difference 
in the sound level.  The difference is the difference in the loudness.  The loudness of a sound wave depends on the amount of energy it carries to the ear. Therefore, loudness is the sensation in the ear that depends on the amount of energy carried by the sound wave.
The sound generated by plucking a stretched string is louder when it is plucked 
harder so as to displace it further from its stationary position.  In order to displace the string further, a larger amount of work has to be done on the string.  Then the string imparts a larger amount of energy to the sound wave it generates.  When the string is displaced further from the stationary position, the amplitude of the vibration becomes larger and the amplitude of the sound wave generated by the string also becomes large. This means that there is a relationship between the loudness of a sound and the amplitude of the corresponding sound wave.  Therefore, loudness can also be considered as the characteristic of sound that varies according to the amplitude of a sound wave.  Loudness increases with increasing amplitude.  Loudness decreases with when the amplitude decreases.  Figure 4.31 shows wave forms of two sound waves viewed using a cathode ray oscilloscope, one with a higher level of loudness and the other with a lower level of loudness.

4.3.4   Hearing Range
We cannot hear all the sounds in our surroundings.  Certain sounds that we cannot 
hear are heard by other animals.  While animals such as elephants that have large ears can hear sounds of very low frequencies, the ears of animals like bats and whales are sensitive to very high frequencies. It is generally considered that the frequency range that can be heard by the human ear is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  This frequency range is known as hearing range of human ear. However, the high frequency limit audible to the human ear decreases gradually with age.  
Sounds of frequency below 20 Hz are called infra-sound and sounds of frequency above 20000 Hz are called ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound waves are sound waves with frequencies above the hearing range of humans.
While Rabbits, dolphins and bats can hear frequencies above 20,000 Hz (ultrasound), elephants can hear frequencies below 20 Hz (infra-sound). Dogs can hear sounds up to about 40,000 Hz.

² Uses of Ultrasound 
Ultrasound waves are used for various important tasks. Ultrasound waves are employed	to	find	the	depth	of	the	sea.		For	this,	an	instrument	called	SONAR	(Sound	Navigation	and	Ranging)	fixed	to	the	bottom	of	a	ship	emits	an	ultrasound	pulse.  The depth of the sea can be found by measuring the time taken by these ultrasound	pulses	to	return	to	the	original	position	after	being	reflected	from	the	bottom of the sea.

In addition to measuring the depth of the sea, ultrasound waves are used to

Ultrasound waves are used in ultrasound spectacles worn by blind people.
Ultrasound waves are used to examine internal organs of the human body. This is known as ultrasound scanning. Ultrasound waves emitted by an ultrasound transmitter	placed	on	the	chest	of	a	patient	are	reflected	back	from	the	internal	walls	of	his	heart.		Using	the	reflected	wave,	information	regarding	the	volume	of	blood	sent out during a single compression of the heart, the size of the heart and pulse rate of the heart can be revealed.  
Furthermore, ultrasound waves can be used to observe the womb and the condition 
of the fetus inside the womb of a pregnant mother.

High frequency ultrasound waves do not enter air after traveling through a solid 
medium.  If an ultrasound wave traveling in a solid comes across an air gap, the wave does not penetrate through the air gap. This principle is used to detect dangerous air gaps and fractures in solid components of air planes.
 Extra knowledge
Ultrasound waves are also used to solder metals.  This is done by placing the metals to be soldered in contact with one another and impinging the required place with ultrasound waves.  The vibrations that result cause the two metals to rub each other generating a large amount of heat.  This heat melts the metals at the contact position soldering the two metals.
4.3.5 Musical Instruments
Constantly we hear various sounds.  Some sounds are pleasing to the ear while some are not.  The wave forms observed on a cathode ray oscilloscope screen by playing a tuning fork, a violin and a piano were shown in Figure 4.33.  Although the wave forms were different, they all show repeating patterns.

This wave does not show a repeating pattern.  This wave is composed of irregular vibrations.  The instruments that generate sound that is pleasing to the ear are known as musical instruments.  Musical instruments are built in such a way that they generate periodic vibrations.
There are three main types of musical instruments.
 ²String instruments

Musical instruments that generate sound by the vibrations of a stretched string such 
as the violin, Sitar, Guitar, Banjo and Cello  are known as string instruments.

instrumens.  The xylophone is an instrument with vibrating metal rods. Thalampata and the bell are instruments with vibrating metal plates.
In percussion instruments, the pitch depends on the area and the tension of the 
membrane or the metal plate.

5.1 Reflection of light
We cannot see anything in the dark.  The reason for this is that light is required to 
give rise to visual sensation.  We would be able to see an object only if light from the object reaches our eyes.
Objects that emit light such as a candle flame or a light bulb are known as luminous 
objects.  We can see them because our eyes receive light from them.  Objects that 
do not emit light are known as non-luminous  objects.  When light from the Sun 
or some artificial light source falls on such objects they reflect part of the light and when the reflected light reaches our eyes we see the objects.

Light passes through some objects. They are known as transparent objects (eg: glass, polythene).  Objects through which light does not pass at all are known as opaque objects (eg: stones, bricks).  Light passes through some materials with irregular changes of direction, making it impossible to see the objects on the other side clearly. Such materials are known as translucent materials (eg: tissue paper, oil paper).    
A light ray is represented by a straight line with an arrow head marked on it. The arrow head is essential to indicate the direction of the light ray.

Let us review what we have learned about the reflection of light before.
The dressing table mirrors familiar to you are plane mirrors. The change in the 
propagation direction of light rays incident on a plane mirror is known as reflection.   Figure 5.3 shows how a light ray ( AB) incident perpendicularly on a plane mirror is 
reflected.  BA is the reflected ray.

 ²In figure 5.4, MN is a plane mirror.  AB is a ray that is incident on point B of the 
reflecting surface of the mirror and it is known as the incident ray. This ray is 
reflected along BC .  
 ²BX is an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the mirror at the point of 
incidence. It is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of 
incidence.  
 ²The angle between the incident ray and the normal is known as the angle of 
incidence (i). The angle between the reflected ray and the normal is known as the angle of reflection (r).

First Law
The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie on the same plane.
Second Law
The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.   
That is  i = r
Now let us see how an image is formed when a point object is in front of a plane mirror.

Figure 5.5 – The formation of an image of a point object by a plane mirror
In figure 5.5, a point object O is placed in front of a plane mirror MN.  OA and OC 
are two rays propagating from the object towards the mirror.  These two rays are 
reflected respectively along AB and CD and reach the eye of the observer. 
Not just these two rays, but many such rays from O are reflected by the mirror and 
reach the observer’s eye.  
The observer sees these rays as coming from the point I. Therefore the observer 
sees as if the object is placed at I. 
 ²No rays actually pass through this image.  Because there are no light rays at the location of the image, this image cannot be projected on a screen.  
 ²An image like this is known as a virtual image.  
 ²All images formed by plane mirrors are virtual.
 ²Distance from the object to the mirror (object distance) is equal to the distance from the image to the mirror (image distance).
 ²Images formed by plane mirrors are identical to the objects, but they are lateral inverted. That means the right side of the object appears as its left side, and vice versa.

ambulances is inverted ( AMBULANCE)' However, 
when the ambulance is going behind another vehicle, the driver of the vehicle in front sees it through his rear view mirror as AMBULANCE.
5.2 Curved (Spherical) Mirrors  
We know that the type of mirrors called convex mirrors are used in vehicles so that 
the driver can see the road behind him from both sides of the vehicle. With these the driver can see a large area behind the vehicle, as a small image. In some shops, convex mirrors are used to observe a large part of the shop for security purposes. 
Dentists use another type of curved mirrors called concave mirrors to view inside the 
mouth of patients. These mirrors show enlarged images of teeth. 
Concave mirrors are used for shaving too. 
In both of these cases, the ability of concave mirrors to produce enlarged images is used.  
Figure 5.6 shows an enlarged image from concave mirror and a diminished image 
from a convex mirror.

Now let us discuss more about curved mirrors. 
Mirrors with curved reflecting surfaces are known as curved mirrors. If the curved 
surface is a part of a sphere, the mirror is known as a spherical mirror.

• The cen tre point of the curved mirror ( P) is called the pole of the mirror. 
• The line joinin g the pole P  and the centre of curvature C is called the principal axis. 
• The principal axis is perpendicular to the mirror surface at P.  
5.2.1 Focal point of a curved mirror
For light rays coming along the principal axis, the incident angle is zero and therefore the angle of reflection is also zero.  Therefore light rays coming along the principal axis reflect back along the same path.   
Rays coming parallel to the principle axis towards a concave mirror pass through a point on the principal axis after reflecting from the mirror.  If a screen is placed on that point so as to allow the reflected rays to fall on it, a small bright spot would be visible.  This point marked as F in Figure 5.8 is known as the focus or the focal 
point of the mirror.

Now let us see what happens in the case of convex mirrors. As shown in figure

The focal point of a spherical mirror is situated at the mid-point on the line connecting the pole and the centre of curvature.  The distance between the pole and the focal point is known as the focal length of the spherical mirror.  The distance between the pole and the centre of curvature is known as the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror.  The radius of curvature (r) is exactly twice the focal length (f).

Images formed by concave mirrors
Observe your face through a plane mirror. The image seen in the mirror will be the same size as your face.
Figure 5.15 – A concave mirror shows 
an enlarged image of your faceObserve your face through a concave mirror 
placed closer to the face than the focal length.  You will observe a very large image of your face. In addition it will be an upright and virtual image.
Let us do the activity 5.1 to find the focal length of the concave mirror.

 ²Open the window of a room. 
 ²Hold a concave mirror, turned towards the window as shown in figure 5.16. 
 ²Hold a screen (or a white paper) in front of the concave mirror and adjust the 
distance between the concave mirror and the screen until a clear image of the scene outside the window is formed on the screen. 
 ²Because this image is formed on the screen, it is a real image. 
 ²Measure the distance between the mirror and the screen when you get a very clear, up side down image on the screen. 
Because the light rays coming from a far away object can be considered as parallel, the distance from the mirror to the image can be considered to be approximately equal to the focal length of the mirror.Activity 5.1

 ²Fix a concave mirror on a stand and place it on a table. 
 ²As in the activity 5.2 find the approximate focal length of the concave mirror. 
 ²Keep a lighted candle on the table near the principal axis at a distance about five times the focal length from the mirror. 
 ²Hold a screen in front of the concave mirror and move the screen till a sharp image of the flame is obtained. 
 ²Now try to obtain the image on the screen while moving the candle towards the 
mirror and placing it at different distances from it. 
 ²Is it possible to obtain an image on the screen when the candle is very close to the mirror?  Activity 5.2
The position of the image, the nature of the image and the size of the image formed by a concave mirror depend on the position of the object with respect to the mirror. 
² Drawing ray diagrams for images formed by concave mirrors
The image of a point object placed in front of a mirror is formed at the point where two or more light rays coming from that point meet (or at the point where the extended light rays meet).
 ¾To find the position of the image, it is necessary to consider rays coming from the top and bottom of the object separately.
 ¾If the bottom of the object is situated on the principal axis, all the rays coming from the bottom travel along the principal axis. Therefore the image of the bottom of the object is formed on the principal axis.
Physics  Geometrical Optics
For free distribution 114 ¾Therefore, the image of a vertical object which is located on the principal axis 
is formed on the principal axis.
Therefore, to draw the image of an object which is placed vertically on the principal axis it is sufficient to draw the rays which are coming from the top of the object. For this any two light rays mentioned under the note in pages 110,111 can be used. 
The image of the top of the object is the point of intersection of these two rays.  
A ray diagram can be used to find the nature of the image formed when an object is 
placed at different distances from the mirror.
1. Object between the mirror and the focal point
When the object is positioned between the mirror and the focal point, the image cannot be formed on a screen.  This means that the image is not real.  This image can be seen by viewing through the mirror. Such images are known as virtual images. 
In order to find the location of the image in this instance, consider two rays coming 
from the top of the object.  It would be convenient to choose one of these rays to be parallel to the principal axis and the other to pass through the center of curvature as shown in Figure 5.17. Drawing the ray parallel to the principal axis to return through the focal point after reflection and the ray coming through the center of curvature to return through the same path after reflection, the point of intersection of these two rays can be found by extending the two rays an shown by dotted line.This point is the position where the image of the top of the object is formed.

The image of an object on the focal point must be formed at infinity. This can be

3. Object between the center of curvature and the focal point
For an object placed between the center of curvature and the focal point, it can be 
shown that the image is real, inverted, larger than the object and is formed beyond the centre of curvature, by considering a ray coming from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis and another ray passing through the center of curvature.  The ray diagram for this case is shown in Figure 5.19.

For free distribution 116In order to find the position of the image for an object positioned at the center of

As shown in Figure 5.20, the ray that passed through the focal point returns parallel to the principal axis while the ray that was parallel to the principal axis passes through the focal point after reflection.  It can be shown that these two rays intersect at a point directly below the center of curvature and that the height of the image is equal to the height of the object.  This too is an inverted real image.
5. Object at a point beyond the center of curvature 
In order to find the location of the image in this instance, consider two rays coming 
from the top of the object.  It would be convenient to choose one of these rays to be parallel to the principal axis and the other to pass through the center of curvature as shown in Figure 5.21. Drawing the ray parallel to the principal axis to return through the focal point after reflection and the ray coming through the center of curvature to return through the same path after reflection, the point of intersection of these two rays can be found.  This point is the position where the image of the top of the object is formed.  Here, the image is formed between C and F.  This image is 
smaller than the object, inverted and real.

The image of an object placed very far from a concave mirror is formed on the focal point of the mirror, on the same side of the mirror as the object, smaller than the object and is inverted.  Since this image can be seen on a screen, it is a real image.

For free distribution 118Figure 5.22 shows how reflection of light occur from a convex mirror. 
• In a convex mirror too, rays coming towards the mirror along the principal axis 
are reflected back along the same path after falling on the mirror (figure (a)). 
• Rays coming parallel to the principal axis are reflected as a divergent beam after 
falling on the mirror (figure (b)). 
• These divergent rays appear to be coming from a single point on the principal axis inside the mirror.  This point is known as its focal point. 
• A ray that comes toward the focal point is reflected back along a path parallel to the principal axis (figure (c)). 
• A ray that comes toward the centre of curvature of the mirror is reflected back 
along its own path (figure (d)). This is because any straight line drawn from the centre of curvature to the mirror surface is a normal to the surface.
 
Images formed by convex mirrors
Bring a convex mirror close to your face and observe the image formed in it. Image is upright and smaller image of your face. 
Let us do the activity 5.3 to study the nature of image formed by convex mirror. 
 Apparatus : a concave mirror, a screen, a candle.
Try to repeat activity 5.2 using a convex mirror instead of a concave mirror.
You will find that convex mirrors do not form real images. 
To obtain an image from a convex mirror, you have to look at the object through 
the convex mirror. Activity 5.3
Regardless of the distance between an object and the mirror, you will always see an upright, virtual image from a convex mirror. 
Figure 5.23 shows how the image of an object placed in front of a convex mirror 
is formed.  Here too, the position of the image and its nature can be determined by tracing the paths of two rays coming from the top of the object after reflection just as was done with concave mirrors.

Figure 5.24 - A pencil inside 
a glass of waterPlace a pencil inside a glass of water as shown in Figure 
5.24 and view it from the top.  You will see the pencil as if it is bent.
The reason for this appearance is the bending of light rays 
when they enter from one medium to another medium with different optical properties. Light rays coming to the eye from the part of the pencil inside the water travel through water before reaching the eye through air.  When light rays enter air from water, the direction of the light rays changes.  However, the rays coming to the eye from the part of the pencil above the water level do not change their direction as they travel only through air before reaching the eye.
The bending of light rays upon entering one medium from another medium is 
known as refraction of light . 
Look at a coin at the bottom of a container with water. The coin will appear to be slightly raised above the bottom level of the container. If the coin is in air, the rays from the coin will reach the eye straight. But when the coin is in water, the rays from the coin do not come to the eye straight. When they enter air from water, the rays bend away from the normal to the surface as shown in Figure 5.25. Therefore, the rays from the coin appear to come to the eye from a point slightly above the actual position.

When a page of a book is viewed through a block of glass placed on it, the script on 
the page seems to be raised up a little, also due to refraction.  
A ray of light travelling in one medium bends upon entering a second medium as described above only if the rays arrive from a direction other than at a 90
o angle on the 
surface separating the two media.  The reason for refraction is the difference in the speeds of light from one medium to another.  Light travels at the speed of 3 × 10
8 ms-1. 
When light enters another medium from a vacuum, the speed reduces to a lower value.  A medium with a lower speed of light compared to another medium is called a densermedium. The medium with the higher speed of light is called a rare medium.

The speed of light in several different media are given below.

In order to investigate how light is refracted in entering a block of glass from air 
and when entering from glass back to air let us engage in the following activity.

 ²Place a piece of white paper on a 
drawing board and place a block of glass on it.  Next, mark the edges of the block of glass with a pencil.  In Figure 5.26, the position of the block of glass is marked as PQRS.
 ²Now place one pin (A) vertically at a short distance away from the surface PQ and another pin (B) in contact with the surface.
 ²Next, view the pins through the surface SR and place pin C in contact with the surface SR so as to be collinear with A 
and B and thereafter place pin D at some distance away from the surface so 
that all four pins appear to lie on the same line.
 ²Now remove the block of glass and the pins and draw lines AB, BC and CD 
connecting the points where the pins were placed. Draw also the normal lines to the surface PQ at point B and to the surface SR at point C.  You will obtain 
a diagram like the one shown in Figure 5.26.Activity 5.4
In this diagram, ABCD  is the path of a ray travelling across the block of glass 
which entered the glass medium from air along the line  AB.  Since AB is the ray that 
was incident on the block of glass, it is known as the  incident ray.
XY is the normal drawn to the glass surface at the point of incidence. The angle between the incident ray and the normal is known as the angle of incidence ( i). 
After entering the block of glass, the incident ray travels along BC.  The refracted 
ray (BC) is bent towards the normal at point B. 
The angle between the ray of refraction and the normal is known as the angle of 
refraction  (r).  This refracted ray travels back into air from glass at point C.  This 
means that the ray has emerged back into air.  Therefore the ray CD is known as the 
emergent ray.  The angle between the transmitted ray and the normal drawn to the glass surface at the point of emergence C is known as the angle of emergence  (e).
When light enters from air which is a rare medium to glass which is a dense medium, you will notice that the light rays are refracted towards the normal.  
Physics  Geometrical Optics
For free distribution 122When light enters from glass which is a dense medium to air again, which is a rare 
medium, the light rays are refracted away from the normal. From this activity you will observe that a light ray entering a dense medium from a rare medium refracts towards the normal while a light ray entering a rare medium from a dense medium refracts away from the normal.

When a light ray travels from one medium to another medium if it bend towards the normal, the second medium is denser compared to the first medium. If the ray bends away from the normal, the second medium is a rare medium, compared to the first medium.
5.3.1  Laws of refraction
There are two laws of refraction.
First law
The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the surface drawn at the point of incidence lie on the same plane.
Second law
When light refracts from one medium to another medium, the ratio of the sine of the incident angle to the sine of the refracted angle is a constant that depends only on the two media. This constant is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium.
The second law above  is also called Snell's law.
Index of refraction  ^n& =  sine of the incident angle  =  sin i
sine of the refracted angle     sin r
For a light ray that travels from air to glass, the refractive index is written as ang .  
Physics  Geometrical Optics
For free distribution 123For rays that enter from glass to air, the refractive index is written as  gna.
       refractive index of water relative to air anw   = 1'33
     refractive index of glass relative to air  ang    = 1'5
The refractive index defined above is the refractive index of one medium relative to 
another medium. Therefore, it depends on both media. If we use a vacuum instead of the first medium (if we consider a light ray entering from a vacuum to some medium), then the refractive index depends only on one medium. This is normally referred to as the refractive index of that medium.
For example, refractive index of water is the ratio of the sine of the incident angle 
to the sine of the refracted angle when a light ray travels from a vacuum to water. Because the velocity of light in air is only slightly different from that in a vacuum, and because it is practically difficult to make measurements of refractive index relative to a vacuum, often the refractive index of a medium relative to air is used as the refractive index of that medium. There are no units for the index of refraction.
5.3.2 Total Internal Reflection and Critical Angle
When a light ray travels from a dense medium to a rare medium, it bends away from the normal, as shown in Figure 5.27.  
air
water
Figure 5.27 – A light ray traveling from water to air
When the incident angle inside the dense medium is gradually increased, the 
refracted ray bends further away from the normal. At a certain value of the incident angle, the refracted ray travels along the interface between the two media, as shown 
in Figure 5.28. In this case, the angle of refraction is 90
o. The incident angle inside 
the denser medium when this happens is called the critical angle .

² Several applications of total internal reflection
Optical fibers  
An optical fibre is a flexible transparent fiber made of glass or plastic. Light rays that enter through one end of an optical fiber travel through the fiber while undergoing total internal reflection and leave the fiber through the other end. Even if the fiber is many kilometers long, light will leave it without a significant loss of intensity. 
The instrument called endoscope, which is used to observe the internal organs of 
the human body, makes use of optical fibers. Optical fibers are now widely used in telephone communication and in Internet connections. They are also used in decorations.

Total internal reflection by prisms
A prism with one angle 90 degrees and the other two angles 45 degrees each can be 
used to produce total internal reflection. Such prisms are used in cameras, telescopes and binoculars. The critical angle of glass is 43 degrees. Therefore, if the incident angle inside glass is greater than 43 degrees, a light ray will undergo total internal refraction.
Figure 5.30 shows a light ray entering one face of a prism perpendicular to the 
surface. This ray is not refracted at that surface. Next if falls on the second face of the prism with an incident angle of 45 degrees. Because this incident angle is greater than the critical angle in glass, the light ray undergoes total internal reflection and travels perpendicular to the third face of the prism. The ray emerges from this face without bending. This technique allows us to bend a light ray by an angle of 90 degrees

5.4  Lenses
A lens is an optical device with curved surfaces, made of glass, plastic or any other transparent material. A lens alters the path of light rays that pass through it by refraction. Images on the retina of our eye are formed by a lens.  
Lenses are used in telescopes and binoculars, which are instruments that help us see 
far away objects clearly. Lenses are also used in the microscope – the instrument that allows us to see very small objects that are not visible to the naked eye. The magnifying glass or the simple microscope that magnifies small objects is also a lens.   
Figure 5.31 - Some instruments with lenses
Many lenses are made of glass. But now plastic is increasingly used for making lenses. Any transparent material can be used to make lenses. Sometimes even liquids such as water are used to make lenses. 
Figure 5.32 shows several types of lenses. Lenses with two convex surfaces are called 
bi-convex lenses. When a lens has one convex surface and the other plane, it is called a plano-convex lens. In a bi-concave lens, both surfaces are concave while a lens 
with a concave surface and plane surface is called a plano-concave lens.

the sphere that forms the surface A is denoted 
as C
2  and the centre of the sphere that forms 
the surface B is denoted as C1. The line that 
joins these two centres C1 and C2  is called the 
principal axis of the lens. At the points where the principal axis intersects with the surfaces of the lens, the principal axis  is perpendicular to the surfaces. Therefore, a light ray that enters the lens along the principal axis will leave the lens without bending. The mid point between the two surfaces of the lens is called the optical centre of the lens. It is possible to show that any light ray that travels through the optical centre passes through the lens without any bending, as shown in figure 5.34.

with a convex lensWhen there is bright Sun light, hold a 
convex lens to Sun light as shown in figure 5.35 and place a white paper in front. Adjust the distance between the paper and the lens until you get a very small patch of light on the paper.
 ²Because the Sun is very far from us, we can consider all rays of light coming from the Sun to be parallel. In this activity you will observe that, when parallel light from the Sun passes through the lens, all of the rays are focused to a single point.Activity 5.5
What will happen to the light rays travelling parallel to the principal axis of a convex lens? After refracting from the lens, they bend towards the principal axis (converge) and travel through a single point on the principal axis. This point is called the focus 
or the focal point of the lens.

Figure 5.36 – The way the rays parallel to the principal axis are refracted by a convex lens
In order to understand how the light rays entering a convex lens parallel to the principal axis, refract  when they go through the lens, let us look at figure 5.36. 
The broken lines in this figure are normals drawn to the lens surface at each point 
where a light ray crosses the surface.
• When such a ray enters the lens, they enter a denser medium from a rarer medium. 
• Then this ray bends towards the normal to the surface. When this ray leaves the 
lens, it enters a rarer medium from a denser medium. Therefore, it bends away from the normal. 
• According to figure 5.36, in both cases the light ray bends towards the principal axis. 
• It is possible to show that all rays that enter the lens parallel to the principal axis, 
after bending as discussed above travel through a single point on the principal axis. 
Physics  Geometrical Optics
For free distribution 129• This point is called the focus or the focal point of the lens. The distance from the 
optical centre of the lens to the focal point is called the focal length of the lens.
Because light can enter from either side of the lens, it is possible to identify two 
focal points for a lens. Both these points have the same distance to the optical centre of the lens.  Normally, when ray diagrams are drawn, the focal point is denoted as F and the focal length is denoted by f. 
 ²Images formed by convex lenses
 ²Open the window of a room.
 ²Hold a convex lens, turned towards the window. 
 ²On the opposite side of the lens, hold a screen (or a white paper) and adjust the 
distance between the lens and the screen until a clear image of the scene outside the window is formed on the screen.
 ²Measure the distance between the  lens and the screen when you get a very clear, up side down image on the screen.Activity 5.6

This distance you measure will be the focal length of the lens.  
The image in the above activity is formed when light rays coming from objects outside the window are refracted by the lens and come together on the screen. Because this image is formed by light rays that actually reach the screen, it is a real image.
 ²Drawing ray diagrams for images formed by convex lenses
The size, nature and position of the images formed by convex lenses depends on the distance between the lens and the object. 
In drawing ray diagrams for images formed by convex lenses, it is convenient to 
use the specific rays shown in figure 5.37.A light ray passing through the optical

Figure 5.38 shows an object placed at point O which is between the lens and the 
focal point F. A light ray coming from the top of the object and traveling parallel to 
the principal axis will go through the focal point F on the opposite side of the lens. 
Another ray coming from the top of the object and traveling through the optical axis C will go straight without any refraction. When these two rays are extended in the 
opposite direction, they will intersect at a point P. The top of the image will be at this 
point. Because the object is vertical, the image should also be vertical. Therefore, the image must be on the vertical line drawn to the principal axis from point P.  This 
image is larger than the object and it is up right. This image can be seen when the eye is placed as shown in the figure. However, because the rays do not actually meet at point P, this image cannot be formed on a screen. Therefore, it is a virtual image.

C1 C2A B
Figure 5.43 – Surfaces of a concave lens
The centre of the sphere that forms surface A is C2 and the centre of the sphere 
that forms surface B is C1. The line that joins these two centre points is called the 
principal axis of the lens. In both convex lenses and concave lenses, a light ray that travels through the principal axis passes through the lens without bending.
The centre point of the lens, labeled as C is called the optical centre. Any light ray 
that goes through  the optical centre travels straight, without bending. Next we have to consider  light rays that enter a concave lens parallel to the principal 
axis. Such rays, as shown in figure 5.44, are refracted away from the principal axis after passing through the lens. That means they diverge. The point from which these divergent rays appear to come from is called the focal point of that lens.

a concave lens, you have to look at the object through the lens. Then you will see an image smaller than the object. This is a virtual image. Whatever the distance between the lens and the object, what you see will be an upright, diminished  virtual 
image. Figure 5.45 shows a ray diagram for an image formed by a concave lens.

A convex lens makes an object look bigger when the object is placed in front of 
the lens at a distance less than the focal length of the lens. This property of convex lenses is used to view magnified images of objects. 
A convex lens  fitted with a handle is called a hand lens or a simple microscope. It 
is also commonly known as a magnifying lens. Figure 5.46 shows the ray diagram for a magnified lens. Magnifying glasses are commonly used for viewing small 
insects, parts of flowers etc.

 ²The Principle of reversibility of light
If the direction of a light ray is reversed, it will follow exactly the same path 
backward. This is called the principle of reversibility of light. This principle is valid even if the light ray is subjected to a combination of many reflections and refractions.(I) (O)

 ²There are two types of mirrors -  plane mirrors and curved mirrors. Curved 
mirrors can be either convex mirrors or concave mirrors.
 ²Images formed by plane mirrors are virtual and upright. They are the same size as the object.

Human body processes  Biology
143 For free distributionBiological processes in 
human body   06
Many different biological processes take place in the human body. We will discuss 
about those processes and the systems specialized to perform them.
6.1 Process of food Digestion 
Energy is required for different biological processes that take place in human 
body. Energy is obtained through food that we take into the body. These food 
contain nutrients such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins are complex organic molecules that do not dissolve in water. These compounds cannot be absorbed into the human body. Therefore they should be broken down into small particles.The process by which the complex organic compounds are converted into simple organic products to be absorbed into the human body is called digestion of food. 
Food digestion takes place in two process namely mechanical and chemical 
processesDuring mechanical process the physical nature of the food is altered, 
E.g. :- Breaking down of food into small pieces by teeth inside mouth.
During chemical process, the insoluble complex compounds are broken down into simple molecules by the action of enzymes.
E.g. :-  Starch is converted into maltose by salivary amylase (ptyalin)  enzyme 
inside mouth. 
There are some nutrients, that can be used by the body without any digestion, such 
as mineral salts, some vitamins, glucose, fructose and galactose.
The organs involved in food digestion, are collectively called as digestive system. 
Human digestive system
Human digestive system is a single tube, that runs from mouth to anus. According 
to the requirement, the structure has changed at different places, and the glands (salivary glands, pancreas, liver) that supply enzymes and other substances (bile) connect at different sites. The functions take place in the digestive system are f ood 
digestion, absorption of digested end products  and removal of undigested 
materials from the body.

Human body processes  Biology
145 For free distributionLet us observe the changes that occur in food at first part of the digestive tract, the 
buccal cavity.
Digestion in the buccal cavity
Mouth opens the buccal cavity to the environment. It is surrounded by muscular lips at the bottom and top. The buccal cavity is made up of upper and lower jaws. Only the lower jaw can be moved. Teeth are present in both jaws. Buccal cavity is  surrounded by cheeks. The tongue is attached to the floor of the buccal cavity. Three salivary glands are present in the buccal cavity. They secrete saliva and the tongue helps in identification of taste, mixing of food with saliva and swallowing. 
A sweet taste is sensed when chewing rice or bread for sometime. Let's discuss why 
it is sweet?
The salivary amylase (ptyalin) enzyme, acts on starch in digestion of food. Starch 
will be partially digested into maltose. Digestion of food starts in the mouth. 
Starch 
salivary amylase  Maltose
When rice or bread is chewed for sometime starch is digested into maltose. As maltose is sweet, we sense the sweet taste.
Initially digested food is formed into a bolus and pushed to the posterior part of the 
buccal cavity. Next food is pushed into the pharynx.
Pharynx is a common area to both respiratory and digestive systems. There is a movable organ called epiglottis found just above the opening of trachea. 
When bolus is swallowed the epiglottis moves down to close the opening of trachea. Then bolus enters into oesophagus without entering into trachea.

Figure. 6.3 - Trachea is closed with epiglottis when food enter into oesophagus
Biology   Human body processes
146 For free distributionEpiglottis helps to prevent entering food into the trachea. When food enters to 
pharynx, respiratory track is blocked by epiglottis. This prolong blockage of trachea may cause death. If the food is not removed instantly, the person may die due to blockage of respiratory tract.Oesophagus is a constricted tube. How is food moved along a constricted tube?
Figure. 6.4 -How the food pass through 
oesophagus The bolus passes through the oesophagus  by  peristaltic movements. As oesophagus is a muscular structure, due to contractions and relaxations of its  wall the peristaltic movements  appear as waves. These peristaltic movements provide the force to propel the bolus forward. 
Then food is moved into stomach by peristaltic movements.   
Digestion in the stomach
The stomach is a dilated sac like organ. Due to the peristaltic activity of muscles in the stomach wall the bolus is  broken down and mixed well into a chyme. Several 
secretions ooze out into the stomach. It is collectively called the gastric juice . 
The gastric juice contains mainly hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsin enzyme. HCl activates pepsin and pepsin starts the protein digestion to produce polypeptides. Renin present in infants causes coagulation of milk. Food retain in stomach for about three hours. Although the digested end products are not absorbed but some water, glucose and some drugs may absorb.
Chyme containing partially digested proteins, digested and undigested carbohydrates, 
undigested lipids, water, minerals and vitamins are released into the proximal part of small intestine, duodenum part by part. 
When the stomach is empty, it continues to contract. When the stomach is empty 
for a longer period of time, the rate of contraction is also high. So it causes a pain. It gives a sense about hunger. Hunger is a signal that indicates the need of food. 
Digestion in the small intestine
The chemical digestion of food mainly takes place in the small intestine. Pancreatic enzymes as well as intestinal enzymes involve in this digestion.
The small intestine is about 7 m in length. The proximal part of the small intestine 
is C shaped and known as duodenum. The duct of the pancreas and the gall bladder opens into the duodenum via a single pore. Pancreatic juice  is secreted into the 
Human body processes  Biology
147 For free distributionduodenum through pancreatic duct. It contains three main enzymes. They are 
trypsin, amylase and lipase. The bile carried through the bile duct is added to it. Bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder.
Bile contains bile pigments, bile salts, bicarbonate ions and water.Due to mixing of bile with food at duodenum, the lipids in food are broken down 
into small droplets by the process called emulsification. Due to this action, enzymes 
get a greater surface area to act on lipid food. 
Intestinal juice secreted by the wall of the intestine contains, maltase, sucrase, 
lactase, peptidase and mucus. Mucus lubricates food and then ease the passage of food materials along the gut. It protects the inner lining of gut wall. Proteins present in wall of stomach and intestine is protected by the protein digestive enzymes as there is a layer of mucus on the wall. 
Let us summarize food digestion takes place in small intestine (See table 6.1)

Fatty acids and glycerol formed by digestion of lipids are absorbed into lacteals. 
Finally they enter into blood circulatory system. When there is high amount of glucose in blood, they are converted into glycogen and stored in liver. In the same way when the concentration of glucose is decreased, glycogen breaks down to form glucose and is added to blood. The unabsorbed materials in small intestine are sent to the large intestine.
Processes in the large intestine
Length of the large intestine is about 1.5 m. It starts with caecum and ends up at anus. The dilated part of the large intestine is  the rectum. The opening of it, is the anus.  The materials entering into the large intestine contain a very small amount of nutrients. Mainly it contains undigested cellulose and water. A small blind ended tubular structure starts at the end of the caecum. It is known as the appendix. It is very small in humans and it may be infected and become swollen. This disease is known as appendicitis. 
Human body processes  Biology
149 For free distributionThe main function of the large intestine is to absorb water from matter received from 
ileum. Thereby making it into semi solid. The matter enterd into large intestine is known as faecal matter. Faecal matter is yellow in colour due to bile pigments in it. Undigested food, microorganisms, epithelial cells and mucus are present in faecal matter.
When large intestine fills with faecal matter, it passes out from the rectum. 
The diseases and disorders associated with digestive system
The chance of getting infections to the digestive tract is high as materials are entered 
into it from outside frequently. Therefore digestive tract catches many diseases and 
disorders. 
Engage in the assignment 6.2 to get knowledge about the diseases and disorders 
associated with digestive system.
Prepare a booklet about the diseases and disorders associated with digestive tract and how to prevent them. Discuss with doctors and refer news papers, 
magazines for information.Assignment - 6'2
Gastritis
Inflammation of inner lining of mucosa of stomach is known as gastritis.  It is a 
common disease among people. Generally known as acidity. The symptoms are, regurgitation of acid to mouth, burning feeling and pain in stomach. When the condition becomes worse, ulcers appear in stomach and duodenal wall. Bleeding can take place.The reasons for this disorder are as follows,
”Skipping of meals
”Consumption of acidic and spicy food
”Excessive smoking and alcohol consumption
”Mental stress
By following healthy food diets and good habits one can avoid the above disease.
Constipation
Difficulty in defaecation due to hardening of faecal matter is known as constipation. Faeces remain in the large intestine for a longer period of time and absorption of water takes place excessively, Thereby this condition may occur.Reasons for constipation are as follows,
yConsumption of food with low dietary fibres 
yNot taking required volume of water
yPostponing of defaecation
Biology   Human body processes
150 For free distributionBy avoiding above conditions and habits one can avoid this disease. Some drugs 
may cause constipation. Due to forceful defaecation, the anal canal may damage and bleeding can occur. Due to constant constipation, haemorrhage may occur.
Typhoid
Typhoid is caused by a bacterium. The pathogen is transmitted through food and water. The bacterium can enter into the body through mouth while swimming and bathing in contaminated water. It may enter into the body through faecal matter of  patient, consumption of contaminated food and flies. Pain in arms and legs, headache and fever are main symptoms. It is a disease which gradually becomes worse. At initial stages constipation can occur. Tongue is covered by a plaque. After sometime stomachache and diarrhoea can occur. Ulcers can form in the small intestine and cause bleeding. Therefore blood is released with faecal matter. Due to ulcers, the wall can be damaged. Disease can be identified by a blood test or stool test. Typhoid can be prevented by getting a vaccine.
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea occurs when the intestines are infected with a virus, bacteria or a parasite.This disease is transmitted by the faeces of an infected person. The main symptom is release of faecal matter in liquid state. Absorption of water in the large intestine will not occur properly. Dehydration may occur due to loss of fluid. If dehydration becomes worse due to diarrhoea, it may be fatal. So it is needed to consume more water and consult a doctor immediately. 
The above two diseases can be avoided by taking preventive measures given below  
yConsumption of boiled drinking water
yRemoval of  breeding places of flies and cover the food to prevent entering 
of flies to food
yAvoid consumption of food which are sold in open places
yUse of water seal latrines
yProper washing of hands with soap after using the toilet
6.2 Process of respiration 
Respiration is a biological process. Gas exchange can be observed in some animals externally.
Respiration in a human is a complex process and it occurs in three stages.1. Gas exchange between external environment and lungs
2. Gas exchange in alveoli 3. Cellular respiration    Intake of oxygen into lungs and removal of gaseous waste in cells occurs in external gas exchange.

When rubber membrane is pulled down in the above activity the volume inside the 
bell jar increases. Then external gas enters and balloons get inflated. When rubber sheath is released, gas inside balloons go out as the volume of bell jar decreases. Likewise gas exchange between external environment and lungs occurs due to changes of volume of lungs.
The system involved in entering O
2 into lungs and release of gaseous waste products  
produced during biological processes is the respiratory system.

Biology   Human body processes
152 For free distributionMain parts of respiratory system are nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, 
bronchioles and alveoli. Internal surface of nasal cavity is covered with mucus. Due to the presence of mucus in the nasal cavity, the lining of it is moist. There are numerous cilia present on the lining of the nasal cavity. The bacteria, dust and other wastes found in inhaled air stick onto the mucus. This prevents the entry of them into the lungs. By rhythmic  movement of cilia the waste materials are sent out. The materials that are collected at pharynx are removed out with saliva.
The changes that take place when inhaled air passes through the nasal cavity are as 
follows.
 yMoisturizing/ Humidifying inhaled air
 yWarming up of inhaled air up to body temperature
 yRemoval of foreign matter from inhaled air
Lungs are present in thoracic cavity. Thorasic cavity is protected by ribs. Inter - costal muscles are present within ribs. The lower limit of thoracic cavity is the diaphragm. Let's study about the initial activity, in the respirotry system. That is the gas exchange between external environment and lungs.
Inspiration
Figure 6.8 - Inspiration
During inspiration, air enters into lungs. For that, the volume of the lungs should increase. To increase the volume of the lungs, volume of the thoracic cavity should be increased. This occurs due to following changes.
Inter-costal muscles contract, 
therefore ribs move up and sternum moves forward. 
At the same time the diaphragm contracts and reduce its curvature. Due to above activities the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and with that volume of lungs increase. So air enter into lungs through the nose.
Expiration
Figure 6.9 - Expiration
For expiration to occur, the volume of the thorasic cavity should decrease to reduce the volume of the lungs.
This occurs due to the following changes.Inter-costal muscles relax. So the sternum 
and ribs move into its original position. The diaphragm relax and becomes curved.

surface. Accordingly, the respiratory surface of human is the wall of alveoli . The exchange of 
gases takes place by diffusion.
Characteristics of a respiratory surface
The adaptations of the respiratory surfaces for efficient gas exchange are  as follows.
 ySurface should be moistened and permeable for gas exchange
 ySurface should be thin for diffusion of gases
 yA larger surface area to exchange large volume of gas according to the 
needs of animals
 ySurface should be highly vascularized

 yThin alveolar wall
 yMoist alveolar surface
 yPresence of a blood capillary network around alveoli
 yPresence of large number of alveolar sacs
Cellular respiration
Oxygen moved through alveoli reacts with simple organic compounds (glucose) 
in cells. In this chemical reaction energy is released, therefore  respiration   is the process of oxidation of simple foods to produce energy for biological activities
within living  cells.
Let us build a word equation for respiration
Glucose  +   Oxygen      Carbon dioxide      +   Water  +     Energy
The balanced chemical equation for respiration is given below.
C6H12O6       +     6O2       6 CO2          +      6 H2O   +      Energy
According to the requirement of oxygen two types of respirations can be identified.
Aerobic respiration and Anaerobic respiration 
We discussed the respiration that takes place inside cells in the presence of oxygen. 
The respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration.
Some organisms can respire without O
2 . Respiration carried out by organisms 
without O2 is known as anaerobic respiration.
Anaerobic respiration that takes place in plants and yeast cells is known as alcohol 
fermentation. The anaerobic respiration that takes place inside these cells can be 
given by the following word equation.
Glucose    Carbon dioxide  + Ethyl alcohol + Energy
When Yeast carries out anaerobic respiration during fermentation, CO2 and Ethyl 
alcohol is produced. This process is an example for alcohol fermentation.
Human body processes  Biology
155 For free distributionAnimals including human cells also perform anaerobic respiration. The anaerobic 
respiration that takes place within animal cells is referred to as lactic acid fermen-
tation. The products of that is given in the equation given below.
Glucose    Lactic acid +  Energy
Have you faced an incident of muscle pain and cramp due to an instant activity like 100m race. That is due to lactic acid, accumulated in muscles. That is a result of anaerobic respiration.
Energy produced during aerobic respiration is higher than energy produced during 
anaerobic respiration. This is because of the incomplete break down of glucose in anaerobic respiration and complete break down of glucose in aerobic respiration.
Energy is produced during anaerobic respiration as well as in aerobic respiration. 
Part of this energy is lost as heat and rest will be stored in ATP (Adenosine Tri - Phosphate) as chemical energy. 
The energy needed for biological processes is released during break down of ATP.Functions of ATP
 ” Storage of energy.
 ” Release of energy.
 ” Act as an energy carrier.
The energy stored in ATP is used for the following requirements
 yMovement of muscles
 yActive transportation
 yChemical reactions that take place within 
organisms
 ySynthesis of complex compounds from simple

 yCommon cold
Causative agent of common cold is a virus. Headache, sneezing, running nose, 
cough are the symptoms of this disease. There is no medical treatment as it is a viral infection. But can treat for symptoms. By avoiding dust and mist like conditions which are good for viral growth can recover quickly.
 yPneumonia
Causative agent of pneumonia is a bacteria or a virus. The lungs are infected and a fluid may accumulate in the lungs. Prolong cold and cough is a reason for pneumonia. It is important to go for immediate medical treatment.
 yAsthma
Asthma is an inflammation that occurs in the body. Dust, pollen, saw dust, fur, smoke are some causative agents. Due to those substances, the bronchioles get inflammated and the cross area of them are reduced causing difficulty in breathing with a sound.
 yBronchitis or bronchiolar inflammation
The bronchioles swell up due to inflammations that occur by viral or bacterial infections. Heavy cough and difficulty in breathing are symptoms. Other than bronchioles, larynx may get infected. As a result, voice may not exit properly.
 yTuberculosis
Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium. Due to multiplication of the particular bacterium within the lungs, the tissues are damaged. Mainly, the lungs are infected. But it may affect other parts of the body. Parts of tissue can be released with phlegm. The lungs are deteriorated and get perforated. Blood release with phlegm due to breakdown of blood vessels.
Symptoms of tuberculosis
 ”Release of blood during coughing 
 ”Fever ”Tiredness
 ”Loss of appetite

It is important  to take precautions and vaccines to avoid tuberculosis. Tuberculosis 
can be cured by proper treatment.
Diseases associated with smoking 
Smoking cause, lung cancer, bronchitis and some other diseases. Sometimes it may cause death.
Human body processes  Biology
157 For free distributionCarbon monoxide (CO) in cigarette smoke is absorbed into blood. CO readily binds 
with haemoglobin and avoid binding of O2 with haemoglobin. Therefore carrying 
capacity of O2 in blood reduces.
Nicotine found in cigarette smoke increases the heart rate temporally.
Due to destruction of cilia in the respiratory tract, bronchioles may swell up and 
get inflamed. It may cause difficulty in breathing. As these epithelial cells expose to cigarette smoke, they may form abnormal cells which develop into cancers.
Passive smokers also get same harmful effects due to cigarette smoke.
Silicosis
Workers work in quarries, coal mines and glass industry expose to silicon containing 
compounds. When these people inhale air with those compounds, they accumulate in alveoli. Then lung tissues get deteriorated gradually. This disease is known as silicosis.
AsbestosisThis disorder occurs due to inhalation of air containing asbestos particles and fibres. 
Tissues of respiratory tract get destroyed due to accumulation of these particles.

Summation of bio chemical reactions that take place in the living body is known as 
metabolism
Examples for several metabolic activities are given below
 ² Production of carbondioxide, water and energy during cellular respiration
 ² Production of urea, uric acid in protein catabolism in liver
When  metabolic processes occur in the cells, necessary as well as unnecessary 
materials are produced. These unnecessary materials should be removed from the body.
The waste products that are produced during metabolic process are called excretory 
materials. Removal of excretory products produced during metabolism from 
the body is called excretion.

Why faecal matter is not an excretory substance?
Faeces is the undigested materials of the digestion  process. Digestion takes place 
within the digestive system. Digestion of food is not a bio chemical reaction that takes place in the cells. So faeces is not considered as an excretory material. The bile pigments that is released with faeces is an excretory substance.

Figure 6.16 - Glomerular filterate collected 
into the cavity of bowman’s capsuleEach afferent arteriole enters into each Bowman's capsule, where they further divide forming a dense network of capillaries. It is known as glomerulus. The blood flow  
through the glomerulus is having a high blood pressure because the diameter of efferent arteriole is smaller than diameter of afferent arteriole. So blood gets filtered through the wall of glomerulus and the inner wall of the bowman’s capsule and collected into the cavity of Bowman’s capsule. This process is known as ultrafiltration. This 
filtered fluid is referred to as 
glomerular filtrate. Large molecules like plasma proteins and blood cells are not filtered into the glomerular filtrate. Glomerular filterate is as same as blood plasma. The constituents of glomerulur filtrate are water, glucose, amino acids, vitamins, drugs, various ions, hormones and urea.
Selective reabsorption 
When glomerular filterate moves along the nephron most of the constituents absorb  again into the blood capillaries associated with nephron. This is called Selective reabsorption.  90% of the water, all glucose, amino acids and vitamins part of salts, 
small amount of  urea, uric acid and durgs reabsorb into blood. The composition of glomerular filtrate change with selecteve reabsorption. Then the glomerular filtrate is released into collecting ducts and then to the pelvis. The volume of glomerular filterate formed during one minute in a healthy adult is about 120 cm

the glomerular filtrate reabsorb when it moves along the nephron.

Biology   Human body processes
162 For free distributionLet us discuss some of the diseases associated with urinary system.
Renal failure
Kidneys fail to function due to the weakening of urine filteration process in 
nephrons. Infections by microoganisms, heavy metals (mercury,  arsenic) various medicine and carbon tetrachloride (CCl
4) may cause renal failure. The basic 
symptom is oedema and increase of blood pressure due to accumulation of water and salts. pH of blood decreases due to accumulation of urea and other excretory materials. By taking immediate treatments and healthy life style one can maintain a healthy kidney. If treatments are not taken immediately after the symptoms, acute renal failure may occur within 8-14 days. Then blood is filtered by a machine in a process called dialysis. When both kidneys are failed, a healthy kidney from a 
donor should be transplanted.
NephritisNephritis or swelling of kidney occurs due to infections and toxins. Infections in 
ureters and other changes that occur in the body are reasons for nephritis. During nephritis, it affects glomerulus and also uriniferous tubules. Due to damages occur in glomerulus, the volume of blood flow through it, reduces. So the amount of urine formed also reduces. Therefore the waste materials remaining within the body become high. Sometimes due to damages that occur in glomerules, filtering process is affected and as a result, red blood cells can be passed into the glomerular filtrate. Similarly proteins also can be filtered and due to loss of these essential proteins, strokes may occur. Medical advice should be taken immediately for this condition.
Calculi in kidney and bladderCrystalization of calcium oxalate in kidney and bladder is the reason for this 
condition. When these stones block ureters, severe  pain would occur. Removal of these stones can be done by drugs or a surgery.
These stones can be crushed by applying laser rays / ultra sound waves, and this 
technique is called Lithotripsy technology. 
The feeding habit of a person is also a reason for these stones. Postponing of 
urination is also a reason for the above disorder. Drinking of required volume of water daily is helpful to avoid this condition.

WBC destroy infectious particles that enter the body by phagocytosis. Therefore  
percentages of WBC increase above the normal levels in microbial infections. Investigation of WBC counts in blood helps to diagnose diseases. 
The function of WBC is to protect the body from infectious particles that enter the 
body. This is done by phagocytosis and by producing antibodies. 
Platelets
In addition to RBC and WBC there are fragments of cells that cannot be considered 
as cells in human blood. These corpuscles without nuclei are known as platelets. One cubic milimetre of blood contains 150 000-400 000 platelets. They form in bone marrow. Life span of platelets is approximately 5-7 days. Due to diseases like Dengue and Leptospirosis, platelet count drops drastically. Platelets contain thromboplastin which help in coagulation of blood.
Blood plasma92% of blood plasma is water. Other than water the second most abundant compound

Figure 6.23 - Double circulationOrgansInferior vena cavaSuperior vena cavaThe circulation where 
blood flows through lungs 
is known as pulmonary 
circulation. The circulation where blood flows through the rest of other organs is known as systemic circulation. Right ventricle of the heart acts as the pump for the pulmonary circulation, and left ventricle for the systemic circulation. So it 
is clear that blood flows twice through heart before entering into systemic artery. In human, when the blood circulates once through the body it flows twice through the heart. This is called as double circulation.
Heart beat
Atria and Ventricles of heart contract to pump blood out of the heart. These contractions and dilations of heart muscle are known as heart beat. The heart beat rate of a healthy person at rest, is 72 beats per minute. Pulse rate is also similar to heart beat rate. 
Cardiac cycle
In one heart beat atria contract when ventricles dilate. Next  ventricles contract, atria dilate. Contraction of atria is known as diastole (0.1 seconds) whereas contraction of ventricles is known as systole (0.3 seconds). After that atria and ventricles are in relax mode and it is known as intervening (0.4 seconds).
Cardiac cycle refers to a complete heart beat from its generation to the beginning of the next beat. The stages of cardiac cycle are as follows;
1)  Diastole - Atrial contraction
2)  Systole - Ventricular contraction
3)  Intervening - Atrial and Ventricular relaxation (complete cardiac diastole)
Electro cardio gram (E.C.G)  is used to get information about heart function. This 
tracing denote the potential changes take place in  cardiac muscle cells during heart function. Three stages of cardiac cycle can be identified in ECG (Figure 6.24).

ECG wave patterns deviate from normal patterns due to dysfunction of heart. Lub - Dup sound in heart beat can be heard by keeping ear or stethoscope on chest. Lub sound is longer than Dup sound. Lub sound is produced when bicuspid and tricuspid valves close in atrial contraction. Next produce Dup sound and it is shorter. This Dup sound is resulted when semi lunar valves close.
Blood pressure
When heart beats, it contracts and pushes blood through the arteries to the rest of the body. This force creates pressure on the ateries. This is called  systolic blood 
pressure.
Figure 6.25  - Measuring of blood pressureNormal systolic blood pressure is  110-120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when heart rests between beats.  A normal diastolic blood pressure is between 70-80 mmHg. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
Normal resting blood pressure is mentioned as follows
Blood pressure (B.P) } 120$80 mm Hg
Ageing, sex, stressful mentality, diseases of a human are the factors that can increase blood pressure.

tissue fluid. Materials exchanged within somatic cells and blood occurs through this tissue fluid.
Part of tissue fluid is absorbed back to capillaries. Excess tissue fluid within intercellular spaces connect with blood circulatory system through a special tubular system known as lymphatic system.

flowing due to pressure caused by muscles around lymph vessels. All the lymph vessels in the body form two main vessels. They are,Thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct. 
Thoracic duct empties lymph to left subclavian vein. Right lymphatic duct empties lymph to right sublavian vein and then to the venous circulation at last.

 ²Artherosclerosis
 ²Heart attack
 ²Hypertension
 ²Thrombosis Assignment  - 6'5
Artherosclerosis
Cholesterol is  an essential lipid compound produced by the liver. As cholesterol is insoluble in water it is transported as lipo proteins by combining with proteins. Lipo proteins are of two types. Low density lipo proteins ^LDL& and High density lipo 
proteins ^HDL&. Excessive amount of low density lipo proteins deposit in coronary 
arteries and other arteries. Thereby the size of the lumen in arteries reduces. The lipid deposits like this in arteries are called Atheroma and the condition that occur is called Artherosclerosis. 
Due to blocking of coronary arteries, the blood supply to heart is affected. Some parts 
of the cardiac muscle will be failed to function causing angina (Chest pain). Due 
to blockage of coronary arteries the region of the cardiac muscle will not receive blood and that region is failed. This condition is called heart failure.
The reason to increase LDL is consumption of food containing high amount 
of saturated fatty acids (beef, pork, mutton, full cream milk, egg yolk, prawns, and  liver). By controlling such food types and regular exercises can control artherosclerosis.  
Hypertension and hypotension
Due to deposition of cholesterol inside arteries, the size of the lumen reduces. Therefore blood supply to different organs get lowered. So to supply required amount of blood, heart has to exert more pressure. The higher pressure exerted onto the arterial wall is called hypertension pressure. Reduction of elasticity of the artery or arteriole wall also a reason for hypotension.  
Biology   Human body processes
172 For free distributionReduction of consumption of saturated fatty acid is important to control this 
condition. One has to avoid smoking, consumption of alcohol, mental stress, obesity to control hypertension. 
Hypotension is the low blood pressure. The blood become less than the normal.  Low 
blood pressure occurs mostly due to nutrient deficiencies. During this condition one has to get treatments to increase blood pressure to normal quickly.
Thrombosis
When  blood supply to a certain organ is affected due to a blood clot in a blood vessel is called thrombosis. If blood supply to a part of the brain is affected due to a blood clot, the organs that are controlled by that part of the brain fail. This condition is normally called paralysis. If the function of heart is affected due to a blood clot 
in the coronary artery it is called coronary thrombosis. Due to this, heart attack
may occur.
Thrombosis can be controlled by steps taken from child hood. They are as follows,
 ²Avoiding alcohol and smoking
 ²Reduction of consumption of food containing saturated fatty acids.
 ²Consumption of food with more fibre
 ²Reduce salt consumption
 ²Reduce body weight by proper food habits
 ²Regular physical exercises
 ²Peaceful mental status
If there is a record about heart attacks, hypertension, diabetes in family history, one 
has to be more careful about this condition.
6.5 Coordination and homeostasis in human
Do you remember taking away your leg, when a thorn pricks your foot? This action 
has taken place as living beings have the ability to respond to stimuli coming from external and internal environments. That is known as irritability. 
Above response is due to  adaptation of body according to the changes of 
external and internal environments. That is called coordination. The change 
that takes place in the external environment which is detectable by the sensory organs is called a stimulus. The organs that can detect (sense) the stimuli  are called 
sensory organs (receptors). Eye, nose, ear, tongue and skin act as sensory organs.

The reaction for a stimulus is known as a response. The response is done by 
effectors.  Muscles and glands act as effectors.
Recall the incident about the thorn prick. Touch due to the thorn prick on the leg is 
the stimulus. The receptor of that stimulus is the skin. Taking the foot away is the response to that  stimulus. Responding is done using muscles of the foot and that is the effector.
When you sense smell of tasty food, saliva  is secreted into the mouth. State 
the stimulus, sensory organ, response and effector in this action.Assignment - 6'7
You will understand that there should be a proper communication between organs/
tissues to carry out body functions smoothly. Identification of the changes in the external and internal environments and responding accordingly is done by the coordination.
For coordination, two inter connected but different systems present in the human 
body.
 ²Nervous system
 ²Endocrine system
The coordination done by nervous system, is called nervous coordination, and coordination by endocrine system is called chemical coordination. In nervous coordination, impulses transmit through nerves and these impulses aim at a specific effector. In chemical coordination hormones secrete to blood and according to the concentration of hormone the particular effector respond to it.
Biology   Human body processes
174 For free distributionNervous coordination
Due to an electro chemical change in the nerves, impulses are transmitted through 
nerves. A proper coordination is maintained between the receptor and the effector.

neurons in the nervous system.

We know that there is a proper coordination maintained by nervous system between 
the receptors and effectors in the body. The impulses are sent from receptors to the central nervous system and from central nervous system into the effectors. The functional unit of the nervous system  that maintains the coordination is called 
the reflex arc.
Three types of nerve cells involve in a reflex arc. They are sensory neuron, inter 
neuron and motor neuron. The reflex actions take place with the involvement of the reflex arc.
Reflex actions
A sudden, involuntary response to a particular stimulus is called a reflex action. 
They take place without the consciousness of the involvement of the brain.
The reflex actions are of two types as, spinal reflexes and cranial reflexes.

The nervous supply from the autonomic nervous system is to the internal organs 
of the body which are involuntarily controlled. This nervous system coordinates involuntary activities in the body.The coordinating centres of the autonomic nervous system are hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two parts.

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems cause opposite effects. The 
sympathetic system activates when a person is at emergency. It causes fight or flight effects.

Homeostasis
Maintenance of constant internal environment is called homoeostasis.
The internal environment is the immediate surrounding of the cell which provides 
medium for the cell to survive. The tissue fluid around cells, the plasma around 
blood cells and lymph are included into the internal environment.
When internal environment is constant, the conditions inside cells is also constant. 
If there is a small change in the internal environment it highly affects the cellular activities. Therefore the internal environment should maintain stable conditions or within a narrow range, which can be tolerated by the cells. If not, automatic control 
system will be active with feedback mechanisms.
The factors in the internal environment that has to be regulated
 ²Blood glucose level
 ²Body temperature
 ²Water balance
Regulation of blood glucose level
Blood glucose level of a healthy adult is 80-120 mg/100 ml of blood. When blood 
glucose level is greater than the normal level beta cells in islets of  langerhans  in pancreas secrete more insulin. This hormone converts glucose into glycogen and then glycogen store in liver. Further excess glucose is converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue.
When blood glucose level is less than normal (when a person is starving) alpha 
cells in islets of langerhans in pancreas are stimulated to secrete more glucogen. This glucogen acts on glycogen stored in liver to convert it into glucose and release into blood. The blood glucose level will be increased to normal level.Due to the activities of insulin and glucogen, blood glucose level is regulated. Due to absence of beta cells or secretion of insulin will cause diabetes.

Human is a homoithermic organism. Homoithermic means maintenance of con -
stant body temperature irrespective to the fluctuations of temperature in the envi-
ronment. Normal body temperature of human is 37 0C. But it can vary from 36 0C 
to 37.5 0C.
Thermo regulatory centre of the human is present in the hypothalamus of the brain. When environmental temperature drops to avoid the decrease of body temperature, hypothalamus stimulates and carries out the activities below.
 ²Reduce blood supply to skin to reduce heat loss, by contracting blood capil -
laries in the skin.
 ²Reduce production of sweat in sweat glands and reduce heat loss.
 ²The hairs become erect and trap an air layer to act as a heat insulating layer.
 ²If the heat loss is high, heat is generated by shivering.
When temperature of the internal environment increases, to prevent the increase of body temperature, the hypothalamus stimulates to activate the processes as follows,
 ² Dilate blood vessels in the skin and thereby increase blood supply to skin and increase heat loss.
 ² Increase sweat production by sweat glands. When sweat is evaporated heat is absorbed by body and decrease body temperature.
Regulation of body temperature is done by the hypothalamus.
Regulation of water balance
When the water level of blood drops, pituitary secretes ADH (Antidiuresis hormone). This ADH acts on kidney to increase reabsorption of water, thereby reduce the amount of water released with urine.
When water level in blood is high, the reabsorption of water decreases and the amount of water released with urine increases.
Accordingly water balance in the body is regulated.

Chemistry Acids, Bases and Salts  Chemistry
190 For free distributionAcids, bases and salts are used for various activities in our day to day life. To 
inquire into your prior knowledge about acids, bases and salts, do the following assignment.
Assignment - 7.1
Given below are several substances which we frequently use in our day to day life. Classify them as acids, bases and salts and tabulate.Lime juice, Jeewani solution, antacid tablets, milk of magnesia, toothpaste, vinegar, salt, lime, soap, vitamin C tablets, saline solution
7.1   Acids
When you were answering the assignment 7.1 above, you could have classified lime juice, vinegar and vitamin C in that list under the acids.
You have used various acids in the laboratory experiments also. Hydrochloric acid 
(HCl), nitric acid (HNO
3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are some acids that are often 
used in the laboratory.
Figure 7.1 - Some acids that are being frequently used  
  
When considering the formulae of the above acids it is clear that hydrogen (H) is a component element in all those acids.
 ²What is an acid@ 
An acid is a compound that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in an aqueous medium. 
Hydrochloric acid ionises as follows in the aqueous medium and releases H+ ions.Acids, Bases and SaltsChemistry
07
Chemistry Acids, Bases and Salts  Chemistry
For free distribution191Acids, Bases and Salts
191HCl (aq)  H+ (aq)  +  Cl- (aq)
Based on the strength of releasing H+ ions in the aqueous medium, acids are 
classified as strong acids and weak acids.
 ²Strong acids
The acids that release H+ ions by complete ionisation in aqueous medium are 
strong acids. It means that all such acid molecules are dissociated into H+ ions and 
the corresponding negative ions in water. For example, in an aqueous solution of 
hydrochloric acid which is a strong acid, there are only H+ ions and Cl- ions but no 
free HCl molecules.
Given below are a few examples for some strong acids and how they ionise in the 
aqueous medium.
•  Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
HCl (aq)  H+ (aq)  +  Cl- (aq)  
•   Sulphuric acid (H2SO4)
H2SO4 (aq)  2H+ (aq)  +  SO42- (aq)  
•   Nitric acid (HNO3)
HNO3 (aq)  H+ (aq)  +  NO3 -(aq)  
 ²Weak acids
The acids which release H+ ions in aqueous medium by incomplete or partial 
ionisation are called weak acids. This means that in aqueous medium, only a fraction of such acid molecules are dissociated into H
+ ions and relevant negative ions. The 
unionised  molecules remain as molecules themselves in aqueous solution.
Examples for weak acids:  Acetic acid (CH
3COOH)
  Carbonic acid (H2CO3)
  Phosphoric acid (H3PO4)
Most of the acids in laboratory stores are concentrated acids. Dilute acids of 
required concentration can be prepared by mixing such concentrated acids with 
water. Acids of low concentration are known as dilute acids.

192 For free distribution ²Properties of acids
 ³Pay your attention to the warning symbol in Figure 7.2 
seen in the label of the bottles containing concentrated acids. This is a warning about the corrosive nature of the relevant  chemical. That is, when they come into contact with substances like wood, metals or cloth they corrode them and if spilled on the skin, they cause severe burns. This shows that acids have corrosive properties.
 ³Recall the taste of lime juice. It is sour. A common feature of acids is that they have a characteristic sour taste.
    Caution: You should not taste the acids used in the laboratory.
 ³Dilute acids react with metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series forming the salt of the metal and hydrogen gas.
               
Mg (s) +  2HCl (aq)    MgCl2 (aq)  +  H2 (g) 
 ³Think back on the experiment carried out to prepare carbon dioxide gas in the laboratory. Carbon dioxide was prepared by adding diluted hydrochloric acid to calcium carbonate.
      
CaCO3 (s) +  2HCl (aq)    CaCl2 (aq)  + H2O (l)  +  CO2 (g)
Production of carbon dioxide by reacting with carbonates/bicarbonates is a characteristic feature of acids.
 ³Acids react with bases to form salts and water.
The salt sodium sulphate (Na
2SO4) and water are formed as the products of the 
following acid - base reaction.
H2SO4 (aq) +  2NaOH (aq)    Na2SO4 (aq)  + 2H2O (l)
 ³Acids turn the colour of blue litmus red. This is a simple test used to identify acids.

7.2 Bases
Pay your attention to the substances classified under bases in the table prepared during assignment 7.1. Milk of magnesia, toothpaste, soap and lime are examples for bases.
Many bases are encountered as solids. Ammonia is a gas showing basic properties. 
Aqueous solutions prepared by dissolving bases in water are used in laboratory experiments. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and ammonia solution (NH
4OH) can be given as the bases frequently used in the laboratory.

 ²What is a base@
A base is a chemical compound that increases the hydroxyl ion (OH-) concentration 
of an aqueous solution. For instance, in aqueous solution, sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) ionises as follows and contributes to raise the OH- ion concentration.
NaOH (aq)    Na+ (aq)  + OH- (aq)
 ²Strong bases
The bases that completely ionise in aqueous solution are called strong bases. Examples for some strong bases and how they ionise in aqueous solution are given below. 
•  Sodium hydroxide
NaOH (aq)  
  Na+ (aq)  + OH- (aq)
•  Potassium hydroxide
KOH (aq)    K+ (aq)  + OH- (aq)
 ²Weak bases
The bases which partially ionise in aqueous solution are known as weak bases.
Ex : Ammonia solution (NH4OH) 
     
 ²Properties of bases
 ³They have a slimy texture as in soap.
    Caution :  Do not touch bases in the laboratory.
 ³Bases react with acids to give salts and water.
2NaOH (aq)  + H2SO4 (aq)   Na2SO4 (aq)  + 2H2O (l)
 ³Bases turn red litmus blue. This is a simple test used to identify bases.

Identification of acids and bases by indicators is not a very accurate method. 
Moreover, by using it, a value for the strength of acids or bases cannot be obtained. 
Indicators help to identify a given substance as an acid or a base approximately.
 ²pH scale
The pH scale is used to indicate how acidic or basic a given solution is. The scale 
generally consists of a series of numbers from 0 to 14. Each number corresponds to a colour.
Figure 7.4 - pH scale and colour code of pH papersAcidic BasicNeutral
According to this scale the pH value of neutral substances such as water is 7.  The pH value of acidic solutions is less than 7 whereas the pH value of basic solutions is greater than 7. Acidity decreases from 0 to 6 while the basicity increases from 
8 to 14.
 ²pH papers
Like the litmus papers, these are available in the form of books or rolls in the 
laboratory. These have been prepared by mixing several indicators. The pH value can be found by dipping a pH paper in the relevant solution and comparing the colour of the paper with the colour code. Accordingly, the acidity, basicity or the neutrality of the solution can be identified. Further, it gives an idea about the strength of the acid or the base.

1977.3 Salts
The common salt (NaCl) that we use in our day to day life is a salt. The Jeewani 
solution given during ailing conditions such as diarrhoea and the saline solution given to patients are mixtures containing salts.
Acids react with bases to form salts.
Ex (¡ Hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide forming sodium
           chloride.
           NaOH (aq)  + HCl (aq)   NaCl  (aq)  + H2O (l)
    Hydrochloric acid reacts with potassium hydroxide to form potassium
          chloride.
          KOH (aq)  + HCl (aq)   KCl  (aq)  + H2O (l)
          Nitric acid upon reacting with magnesium hydroxide gives magnesium 
          nitrate.
                 Mg(OH)2 (aq)  + 2HNO3 (aq)   Mg(NO3)2 (aq)  + 2H2O (l)
Depending on the strength of the acid or the base reacting, the salt shows acidic, 
basic or neutral properties.
Ex ( The salts formed by the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base show 
neutral properties.
Sodium hydroxide is a strong base. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Sodium 
chloride formed by the reaction between them is a neutral salt.
NaOH (aq) +  HCl (aq)    NaCl (aq)  + H2O (l)
Salts are crystalline, solid compounds. Most of the salts dissolve in water. Generally salts have high melting points and boiling points.
 ²Uses of some salts
• Sodium chloride
 ³Used to flavour food during their preparation
 ³Used as a food preservative
 ³Used to produce chemicals such as chlorine and hydrochloric acid, to produce sodium hydroxide to produce sodium carbonate by  solvay process, to glaze earthenware, to make soap and also used in tanning

7.4 Neutralisation
You know that antacid tablets which contain a basic substance are used to relieve 
the discomfort caused by the acidity in stomach. Have you inquired into the reason for it?
You have studied the fact that when acids react with bases, salts and water are 
produced. Let's consider the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide again.
 
 HCl (aq) +  NaOH (aq)    NaCl (aq)  + H2O (l)
Let's investigate how water was formed as a product in the above reaction. The H+ 
ions released by the ionisation of the acid combine with the OH- ions given by the 
ionisation of the base to form water molecules. it can be represented by a chemical equation as follows.
H+ (aq) +  OH- (aq)    H2O (l)
In all acid - base reactions, the above common reaction occurs. This process is known as neutralisation.
Neutralisation is the combination of H
+ ions released by an acid with OH- ions 
released by a base to form water molecules.Hence, when an acid reatcs with a base their acidic properties as well as the basic 
properties disappear.

199 ²Applications of the acid -  base neutralisation reactions
 ³Milk of magnesia or such an antacid (a weak base) is used to neutralise the 
acidity in the stomach.
 ³Basic substances such as ash and quicklime (calcium oxide) are added to soil to reduce soil acidity.
 ³Bee sting is painful because of an acidic  poisonous substance injected into the skin. By applying a weak basic substance such as baking soda (NaHCO
3) or 
calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on the place of the sting, the pain is relieved.
 ³Wasp sting is basic. Application of a weak, dilute acid such as lime juice or 
vinegar on the place of sting reduces the venomous nature as well as the pain.

Recall again about the evidences you have learnt in grade 10 to ensure that a reaction 
has taken place. Do the following activity to study further about it.
 
    Activity 8.1
Materials required ; -  Two small beakers about 100 cm3 , A thermometer, a glass 
rod, solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH), solid ammonium chloride (NH
4Cl)
Method; -  Add about half full of water to a beaker, measure its temperature and note it down. Add a little amount of solid sodium hydroxide to the same beaker, stir with the glass rod and again measure and record the temperature. State your observations.
Fill half of a beaker with water and record its temperature. Add a little amount 
of solid ammonium chloride to this beaker. Stir with the glass rod and record the temperature again. State your observations.
It can be observed that when  solid sodium hydroxide dissolves in water the 
temperature rises whereas when solid ammonium chloride dissolves in water, the temperature falls. The reason for the temperature changes happening in the above two instances is the heat changes accompanying them.What is the reason for the increase in temperature when solid sodium hydroxide dissolves in water? The temperature increases because of the loss of heat.Why did the temperature decrease when solid ammonium chloride was dissolved in water?In this case, temperature decreased because of the absorption of heat.The temperature change can be considered as a measure of the amount of heat either evolved or absorbed.In order to explore further about the heat changes occurring in a chemical reaction, let us conduct the following activity.

Materials   required: -   A small beaker, a piece of magnesium strip, dilute   
       hydrochloric acid, a thermometer
Method: - Add about 10 cm3 of dilute hydrochloric acid to a small beaker and 
measure its temperature. Add a piece of magnesium ribbon about 2 cm long 
into it. Measure the temperature at the end of the reaction again. Record your observations.
When magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid, the temperature has increased. That means, when this reaction happens heat is lost. The chemical reactions happening with the evolution of heat are called exothermic reactions. Exothermic reactions can be represented simply as follows.
Reactants  Products +  Heat
The exothermic reaction studied in activity 8.2 can be represented by the following 
equation.
Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq)  MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)  + Heat
The reason for the evolution of heat in an exothermic reaction is that the energy contained in the products is less than the energy content of the reactants.An exothermic reaction can be illustrated by an energy level diagram as follows.

Materials   required : -   A small beaker, a solution of citric acid, a solution of sodium  
        bicarbonate
Method : -  Add about 10 cm3 of the citric acid solution to a small beaker and record 
its temperature. Record the temperature of the sodium bicarbonate solution also. 
Add about 10 cm3 of the sodium bicarbonate solution to the beaker containing 
citric acid, stir and note the temperature. State your observations.
When the reaction between citric acid and sodium bicarbonate occurs, the temperature decreases. The reason for this decrease in temperature is the absorption of heat during the reaction. The reactions taking place with the absorption of heat are known as endothermic reactions.An endothermic reaction can be simply represented as follows.
Reactants +  Heat  Products
The reason for the absorption of heat during an endothermic reaction is the fact that the energy in the products is greater than the energy in the reactants.An endothermic reaction can be represented by an energy level diagram as follows.

To two beakers, measure 50 cm3 of the sodium hydroxide solution and 50 cm3 of 
the hydrochloric acid solution separately using the measuring cylinder. With the 
thermometer, measure the initial temperatures of the two solutions.
(After measuring the temperature of the solution of the base, wash the thermometer 
before measuring the temperature of the acid solution . Mix these two solutions in a polystyrene cup, stir with the glass rod and record the maximum temperature.
Chemistry  Chemistry Heat Changes Associated with Chemical Reactions
206 For free distributionThe heat change associated with the reaction can be calculated using the following 
equation.
Q  =  m c θ
m = Mass of the substance accompanying the exchange of heat
c  = Specific heat capacity of the substance related to the heat changeθ  =  Temperature change in the mixture (maximum temperature - initial temperature)If the temperatures of the solutions of the base and acid are different, their mean 
should be taken as the initial temperature.
This calculation is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of heat of the 
reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid is used to raise the temperature of 100 cm
3 of the solution. Since dilute solutions were used for mixing, 
it is also assumed that the specific heat capacity of the solution is equal to that of water and the density of the solution is equal to that of water.
Specific heat capacity of water = 4200 J kg
-1 0C-1
Density of water          =  1  g cm-3
Mass  of  100 cm3 of water    = 100 g
Let us assume that the observed temperature change in the experiment is 10 0C
                      Q    =  m c θ
                  =  100
1000  kg x 4200 J kg-1 0C-1 x 10 0C
                  =  4200 J
The experiment gives the heat change that results when 50 cm3 of the 2 mol dm-3 
sodium hydroxide solution reacts with 50 cm3 of 2 mol dm-3 hydrochloric acid 
solution.

hydroxide reacts with 1 mol of hydrochloric acid can be calculated.
The quantity of heat released when  
0.1 mol of NaOH reacts with 0.1 mol of  HCl  =  4.2 kJ 
Quantity of heat released when 1.0 mol of  NaOH reacts with 1.0 mol of HCl   = 4.2 kJ
  0.1 mol      
       =  42 kJ mol-1
This is the heat of reaction of the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid.(This is an experimental value).
Extra knowledge
When conducting this experiment loss of heat to the surroundings and absorption of 
heat by the container occur. Neglecting these leads to an error in the calculation. To minimize it, a thermally insulating polystyrene cup is used. To keep the temperature uniform throughout the mixture, the mixture should be stirred well with a stirrer or a glass rod.
In the above experiment, we determined the heat change associated with the reaction  
between aqueous sodium hydroxide and aqueous hydrochloric acid.
HCl (aq)  + NaOH(s)    NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)
The above experiment can be carried out using solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH (s)) 
too. But the heat change here is different from the previous value.

state of the reactants and the products should be indicated (Solid, liquid, gas, aqueous)
Exothermic and endothermic reactions are important in various activities in day 
to day life. We meet our energy requirements by burning fuels. Coal, bio gas (methane), and petrol (a mixture of hydrocarbons) are few examples. The energy liberated during the combustion of these fuels are used for various tasks such as running vehicles and operating machinery in factories. Combustion of fuels is an exothermic reaction. The neutralisation reactions taking place between acids and 
bases are also exothermic reaction. Cellular respiration taking place in live bodies are also exothermic reactions.
In the production of slaked lime, water is added to quicklime. During this process, 
lot of heat is liberated. This is also an exothermic reaction.
CaO (s)  + H2O (l)  Ca(OH) 2 (s) 
Next, let us consider about endothermic processes. You have studied the 
photosynthesis happening in green plants. In this, simple sugars are produced by absorbing solar energy. It is an endothermic process.
6CO2 (g) + 6H2O (l)  solar energy
chlorophyll   C6H12O6 (s) + 6O2 (g)
Thermal decomposition of many chemical compounds is also an endothermic process. Consider the production of quicklime by burning limestone. This reaction also absorbs heat.
CaCO3 (s)  CaO (s) + CO2 (g)
Summary
• During every chemical reaction, a heat change also occurs.
• Reactions during which heat is released to the surroundings are called 
exothermic reactions. 
• Reactions in which heat is absorbed from the surroundings are called endothermic reactions.
• The amount of heat released or absorbed during a reaction can be calculated 
using the equation  Q = mc θ
