ixMessage from the Editors 
This textbook that has been written under the new syllabus to be effective from year 
2015 has been designed with a view to imparting knowledge, fostering attitudes and enhancing skills that are necessary for shaping physical, mental, social and spiritual development and for facilitating the creation of the environment required for healthy living through the study of the subject of Health and Physical Education. 
The adolescent children who have come to Grade 11 armed with the knowledge 
gained by studying the subject of Health and Physical Education from Grades 6 to 10 will become adults in a few years’ time. Therefore, beyond providing health education to the pupils, the need for empowering them with self skills for the promotion of health and the path that should be taken in order to achieve that purpose has also been shown through this book, and thus they are expected to contribute towards promoting the health of their families and their communities as well as that of their own.  
The subject matter contained in this book related to health has been sourced from 
the World Health Organization (WHO) while the facts related to physical education are in accordance with the principles, theories and the activities related to physical education and are based on the handbooks on sports published by national and international associations. The facts coming under “For extra knowledge” , which have been included with the objective of enhancing the knowledge of the pupils are considered important to them in addition to those that are contained in the syllabus. By doing the exercises given at the end of each lesson, the pupils can engage themselves in a self evaluation in order to ascertain whether they have properly grasped the facts given through the lesson. Practical skills of the pupils will be enhanced by doing the activities given in this book under the directions of the teachers. 
The chapters in this textbook have been lined up following the lesson sequence that 
has been recomended by the National Institute of Education. Therefore the pupils will get the opportunity in the class to learn these lessons in the same order. 
Since Health and Physical Education is a practical subject, it is very important that 
the facts contained in this book are adopted in day-to-day life. Apart from that, it is also expected that the content of this book be used to shape the life of the pupils without considering it to be merely an examination oriented tool. Especially, the knowledge about sports and physical activities contained in this book should be practised and experienced outdoors rather than learning by heart, for theoretical knowledge will be complete only if it is also experienced practically. 
Our sincere wish is that this book will contribute in creating an active and healthy 
generation so that the outcome of our collective effort is achieved.

1 For Free Distribution.1Let us build a healthy society
School health programmes in Sri Lanka are implemented with the vision of 
building a “healthy and active young generation”. The main objective of these programmes is to obtain the maximum benefit from academic opportunities to improve the health status of school children and develop skills in personal, family and community health promotion. The school health promotion programmes also help to build a healthy environment within schools, carry out immunization programmes, detect unidentified illnesses and impart health education to families.
You have studied the different areas of health promotion in the previous years 
and are now well aware of the concept of total health and the factors that affect it, as well as what steps need to be taken to maintain it.
In this lesson we will focus on learning about health promotion and quality of 
life.
Health Promotion
The World Health Organization definition of health promotion is as follows.
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase                            
control over, and to improve their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental                               interventions.
What is clear from the above definition is that promotion of health is not 
something that is limited to the behaviours of a single individual, but it is a broader concept that requires the involvement of the entire society. It is only by empowering yourself as a person who has the capability to control and improve the factors that affect your health and that of your family and the society that promotion of health can be made a reality.

Centres of health promotion
Health promotion can be carried out in various settings. Just as we can make our 
home a health promoting centre, the school, village, city, hospital and work places can be converted to health promoting centres.
The common strategies of health promotion, which can be utilized in any of these 
settings, are shown in diagram 1.1. They can be used for health promotion in your school as well.
Actions to develop school health promotion
1. Formulation of health promotion policiesThe development of pro health policies can create an environment, favourable to the promotion of health within the entire school system. In formulating a health policy the first step is to identify the current health issues the school is faced with and means of eliminating or reducing these factors. Once the policy is formulated the laws and circulars required to implement the policy are made.
3 For Free Distribution.As students you have a great responsibility to make school health promotion policies 
and work according to them at school level. 
eg: Policies for waste managementSome school health promotion policies are listed below
• Students should be provided with adequate knowledge on health• Clean drinking water should be made available within schools• Schools must have hygienic canteens• The school environment should be accident free• Students who are aged 12 years and below, should be provided with school dental services
• School books should be printed with different font sizes and colours as appropriate for each age group
• The type and the appropriate height of desks and chairs, should be determined for each age group
Figure 1.1 - Providing healthy food 
If we are to build a healthy environment through such policies all stakeholders        including education authorities, principals, teachers, parents and students should be aware of theses policies and they must be in agreement with them.
2.  Building an environment favourable for health promotion
The environment, which we live in has an impact on our health. Listed below are some of the factors that should be present in our physical, mental and social environment to promote health.
 4 For Free Distribution.Physical environment
• Provision of clean drinking water• Provision of adequate toilet facilities - at least one toilet per 50 students• Building class rooms with adequate light and ventilation• Proper disposal of waste - for this purpose methods of waste management should be introduced
• School gardening• Accident and danger free environment• Provision of adequate facilities for sports

Figure 1.4 - Cordial student teacher relationship
3'  Community participation in health promotion
The school health promotion programmes give rise to health promotion in the           community as well. For example, parents and other members of the community assist in the dengue eradication campaign carried out by the school. As a result of this, their awareness and interest in dengue eradication may be increased and therefore they may carry out similar programmes in other places in the community.
Similarly community participation should be enlisted for school health promotion. 
For example, shramadana campaigns by members of the community to minimize accidents that can occur in school premises, constructing a sports ground for the school and reducing cigarette sales outlets around the school to prevent school children from being introduced to smoking, are some of the ways in which the community can aid school health promotion.

4. Developing skills required for health promotion
This involves improving skills to develop health promoting behaviour.eg: Good decision making –  selecting healthy food from what is available in the      market
 Effective communication – the ability to understand what is implied in         advertisements correctly
To improve the health status of a school, workplace or village some behavioural 
modifications are required. Developing skills such as consuming healthy meals, following an active lifestyle and being able to face and manage life stresses successfully are essential for health promotion. Skills can be developed by providing knowledge through books and educational workshops, group competitions, debates and sports competitions.

The government carries out school health inspections to improve the health status of school children. All students must undergo school health inspections during specified periods so that any health deficiencies can be identified and corrected. They are also provided with iron and folic acid tablets. The Public Health Inspector (PHI) carries out an annual School Sanitation Survey through which areas that can give rise to illness or accidents are identified and measures taken to prevent them.
Figure 1.7 - Annual school sanitation survey
In addition, if there are any shortcomings in these services correcting them and making them more efficient, as well as implementing new services for newly identified needs are other methods of health promotion.

 Discuss other factors that affect the quality of life which are not                         
mentioned above.
An individual’s health is a major determinant of his quality of life. As we have learned 
earlier, total health is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, but the presence of physical, mental, social and spiritual well being. Contracting communicable and non-communicable diseases can reduce the quality of life. Therefore quality of life can be improved by improving resilience towards illness by vaccination and good health practices
The improvement in quality of life due to improvement in the health status can be 
measured by the following features.
Features of a community with a high quality of life

For Free Distribution.  28 293 Let us identify principles 
of biomechanics to maintain 
correct postures
Maintaining a correct postures means keeping the body parts in proper positions so 
that minimum amount of  energy is spent and no strain is caused to any part of the body during movement or remaining still. Maintaining correct postures pave the way for the development of a fine personality. It is difficult for every individual to maintain postures in the same way as others. The way that postures are maintained may differ from person to person depending on factors like body weight, body size and age. In order to maintain correct postures, it is important that you learn the principles of biomechanics. 
Out of the principles of biomechanics that influence postures, you learned the two 
principles ‘centre of gravity’ and ‘balance’ when you were in Grade 10.
In this lesson you will learn some more principles of biomechanics that influence 
postures and physical activities, and how the body and equipment are manipulated using those principles.
Principles of biomechanics that influence postures
Postures are mainly of two types:
1. Static postures
 eg: sitting, standing, lying 2. Dynamic postures eg: running, jumping, walking 
The following principles of biomechanics influence these postures.
1. Centre of gravity
2. Balance3. Inertia
4. Force5. Direction of force6. Momentum
For Free Distribution.  28 29As we have already learnt about ‘centre of gravity’ and ‘balance’, let us now study 
the other principles of biomechanics. 
Inertia
Inertia is the property of resistance of a body that remains at rest to move or the resistance of a body that is in motion to stop.
Let us consider two objects (A and B) that have been kept on the ground for lifting. 
If it is more difficult to lift object B than A, inertia of the object B, or the resistance of object B to move, is higher. (Figure 3.1)         
A  B
Figure 3.1
Think of a leather ball and a tennis ball that are rolling over. You will understand that it is easier to stop the tennis ball than stopping the leather ball. This means that inertia of the leather ball is higher.
Force
An effect that causes an object which remains at rest to move or which changes the nature of motion of an object in motion is called a ‘force’. 
When a weightlifter is lifting a barbell that is on his shoulders, he pushes it
upwards. When the barbell that is on the ground is lifted, the weightlifter has to pull it upwards. We see such acts of pushing and pulling in different forms in sports.  (Figure 3.2)  
For Free Distribution.  30 31Actions like pulling, pushing and lifting are results of exerting force.      
Figure 3.2
When a sprint race is about to start, a sprinter stands still bracing his feet against 
the starting block. In order to break this stillness, the sprinter has to exert someinfluence. The influence that breaks the stillness is a force. The force that breaks the stillness of the sprinter is the force of the reaction that is produced as a result of the pressure exerted against the starting block by the sprinter. (Figure 3.3)
When the ball is coming towards a batsman, he hits it with his bat in order to 
change the direction of motion of the ball by exerting some force on it. 
The force necessary for a sportsman for motor activities is generated by the
contraction of his muscles.
When an athlete is throwing the shot put, he has to exert some force on it in order 
to make it move. Further, that force has to be exerted in the direction in which the shot put has to be thrown.
Figure 3.3
For Free Distribution.  30 31
For extra knowledge 
The first law of Newton that you learnt in Science is as follows:  
''Until an unbalanced force is applied on it, bodies at rest remain stationary and bodies in motion continue to move at uniform velocities.''
Apply the first law of Newton to the example given above.
Direction of Force
A force has both a magnitude and a direction. Direction of force, too, has an effect 
on actions. When illustrating the direction of force by drawing a line, the length of the line that is drawn to scale is reflective of the magnitude of the force and the direction in which the force is acting is indicated by the direction of an arrow head. 
A weightlifter exerts an upward force in order to lift a weight. Then that object 
moves in the direction in which the force is exerted. (Figure 3.4)   
Figure 3.4
When an athlete jumps up, the ground exerts a force vertically upwards on the                  athlete because of the force that the athlete exerts on the ground. That means the force acts in the direction of the motion.    
For Free Distribution.  32 33
For extra knowledge 
Recollect the third law of Newton that you learnt in Science.  
“For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”
Apply the third law of Newton to the example given above. 
Momentum
Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop the motion of an object in 
motion. 
When playing ˝Elle˝ it is easy for you to catch the ball that a player throws at you, 
but if a heavier object is thrown at you, it would be more difficult for you to catch it.
Further, even an object that is not so heavy would be difficult to be caught when it 
is moving very fast. 
Accordingly, it is clear that momentum depends on the mass and velocity of an 
object.    
 
The momentum of a shot put that is rolling over fast is greater than the one that is 
rolling over slowly. Further, the momentum of a bigger shot put that is rolling over at a certain speed is greater than that of a smaller one that is moving at the same speed.
When a cricketer catches the ball coming towards him, he exerts some force on the 
ball with both his hands in order to stop the ball (Figure 3.5). Then the momentum of the ball becomes zero as its velocity becomes zero and consequently the ball stops moving.  momentum = mass  x  velocity

Effects of principles of biomechanics on activities
Walking
The purpose of the activity of walking is to carry the body from one place to              
another. While walking, the body moves forwards or backwards and the weight of the body is shifted from foot to foot alternately. Accordingly walking is called an unceasing process in which the balance of the body is lost and regained. 
While walking, the balance of the body is maintained by moving hands and legs in 
opposite directions.
Running
Running is to be pushed forwards by the force that is exerted on the ground by the feet. When running, a runner exerts some force on the ground and consequently an equal and opposite force acts on the runner. The runner moves forwards because of the reactive force that is generated. (Figure 3.6)   
For Free Distribution.  34 35
Figure 3.6
 Figure 3.7
At the start of a 100-metre race, a sprinter remains at rest on the starting block. He 
exerts some force on the block using his feet. As the reactive force generated by the block in response to the athletes force, acts back on him, he is pushed forwards. If that reactive force does not act on him, he remains at rest on the block. (Figure 3.7)    
For extra knowledge 
Apply the second law of Newton that you learnt in Science to the example given above.
“The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the unbalanced 
force acting on it, while it is inversely proportional to its mass.''
According to this law, acceleration of an object or an athlete can be increased byincreasing the force that acts upon that object or the athlete (a higher rate of velocitychange).    
The acceleration produced when a sprinter of a 100-metre race takes off at starting 
block is directly proportional to the force that he exerts on the block. If the force he exerts on the block is greater, the acceleration of taking off the block is greater, too.

Jumping and throwing 
Releasing an object to the air by throwing or shooting forward, is called a projection 
and the object that is projected is called the projectile.
In sports and in physical education activities, there are various events in which 
objects are thrown forwards. eg: javelin, shot put, discus 
Moreover, various pieces of sports equipment are thrown forwards using various 
techniques. eg: hitting the ball, kicking the ball
In events like long jump, high jump, triple jump and hurdles, the body of the athlete 
becomes the projectile.      
For extra knowledge 
The centre of gravity of a piece of sports equipment or that of an athlete that is taken-off into the air moves along a circular path in the air. This path is called the trajectory.   
For Free Distribution.  36 37The following figure shows the path of the centre of gravity of a long-jumper 
from the time he takes off until he lands.   
Figure 3.9B A Ch
C  =  Point of taking off B  =  Landing point A-B  =  Distance of the jump h  =  Take-off height 
Factors affecting the distance or the height of the jump of an athlete  
1. Velocity of take-off 2. Angle of take-off 3. Height of take-off
The height or the distance of the jump determined on the above factors cannot 
be changed by the movements that the athlete makes while he is in the air. In an event like long jump, such movements are only useful in preparing the body for a                successful landing. (Figure 3.10)    
Figure 3.10
For Free Distribution.  36 37The velosity of the take-off is the most important one of the above factors. In  
jumping events, the approach run is used to increase the take-off speed. The optimum take-off angle differs according to the event.
The height at take-off differs according to the height of the body of the jumper and 
the position of the body of the jumper at the take-off.   
Factors that determine the distance of the throw are;  
1. velocity of release 2. angle of release 3. height of release 
In throwing events like throwing the shot put, discus throw, javelin throw and 
hammer throw, the distance that the shot put, discus, javelin and the hammer will travel depends on the above factors.
Velocity of release of the equipment
In a throwing event the key factor that determines the distance of the throw of the equipment is the velocity of release of that equipment. The magnitude of the force exerted on the equipment depends on the direction of force, the distance and duration of exerting the force and the speed of release of the equipment. 
In order to attain the maximum speed of the propellers, the thrower uses different 
techniques. A discus or shot put thrower by rotating the body and a javelin thrower by running fast,  gets the speed. (Figure 3.11)   
Figure 3.11
For Free Distribution.  38 39Angle of releases of the equipment
The next important factor is the angle of release of the equipment. In throwing events, the optimum release angle differs from event to event.
When a piece of equipment is released in the proper angle, it can be thrown further 
and when that equipment is thrown at angles greater or lesser in magnitude to the proper angle, the equipment lands at shorter distances.  
Figure 3.12
Height of release of the equipmentIn a throwing event, the height of release of the equipment is a factor that depends on the height of the athlete. An athlete who is taller than another can release the equipment at a greater height when compared to the shorter one. If all the other factors are equal, the athlete who releases the equipment at a greater height is in a slightly advantageous position. (Figure 3.13)

It is important to maintain correct postures in order to live a healthy life.
The centre of gravity and balance, inertia, force, direction of force and momentum, 
are also included in the principles of biomechanics that influence postures.
Inertia is the property of resistance of a body that remains at rest to move or that of 
a body that is in motion to stop.
An effect that causes an object that remains at rest to move or that changes the 
nature of motion of an object in motion is called a ‘force’. A force has both a magnitude and a direction.
Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop the motion of an object that 
is in motion. 
These principles of biomechanics influence in dynamic postures like walking,
running, throwing, and also in sports activities.
In jumping, the path that the centre of gravity of the athlete takes depends on the 
take-off velocity, take-off angle, and take-off height. In throwing, the path that the equipment takes depends on the velocity of release, angle of release, and the height of release.

For Free Distribution.  40 414 Let us play volleyball 
Two teams of six players in each are needed to play volleyball. V olleyball is played 
in a court of 18m x 9m which has been divided crosswise by a net into two equal halves. The team to serve first is selected through the toss of a coin between the two captains. The play starts as the player on the right back of the selected team serves the ball to the opposing team. A team can win a point if the ball lands on the court of the opponent’s side or due to an offence committed by the opposing team. 
Recollect the basic skills of volleyball that you learnt from Grade 6 onwards                 
namely, serving, receiving, setting, attacking, blocking, and defending. The game of volleyball has been created through the combination of those skills. You remember learning the rules and regulations related to attacking and blocking, and the official hand signals used in judging volleyball matches when you were in Grade 10. 
In this lesson, we will learn about the rules and regulations related to positions that 
are very important in playing volleyball.

For Free Distribution.  40 41Positions in Volleyball 
When playing volleyball, the players should comply with the following order of 
rotation of positions:  
The positions of players in volleyball are numbered. The order in which the players 
are positioned before the start of the play is considered the initial order of players. This order should be maintained until the end of the particular round of play. Before the start of the play in each round of a match, the coach of the team should prepare the line-up sheet, sign it and hand it over to the second referee or to the scorekeeper in time. Except for the libero, who is not included in that line-up sheet, the other players are considered to be substitute players of that round. After the line-up sheet that contains the order of players has been handed over, the order of players cannot be changed, but a substitution can be made if necessary. If there is any change in the order of players before the start of the play, it can be corrected in accordance with the line-up sheet and players should be positioned accordingly. A penalty is not given for that. 
Positions of Players 
Figure 4.2 - Positions in volleyballCentre line Attack line Final line
  
While the ball is being served, all the players of both teams, except for the server, should remain inside the court. The six players of each team should stand in 2 rows of three players each. The three players standing close to the net are called the front row and the other three players are called the back row. 
The three players in the back row should be positioned behind the players in the 
corresponding positions of the front row. According to the rules related to the six positions of volleyball, the three positions of the first row are named zone 2,3 and 
For Free Distribution.  42 434, and the three positions in the back row are named zone 5,6 and 1. 
The server should always be in number 1 position.
Although there are several ways of positioning players in volleyball, the beginner 
players are positioned in a ‘W’ formation as shown in figure 4.3.       
  

Figure 4.3 - W formation
The position of a player in the court is determined based on the place in which the soles of the player’s feet lie. The front row player's foot should lie closer than that of the back row player's  foot is to the centre line at least by a small distance. The foot of the side player should lie closer than that of the middle player to the side line. After the ball has been served, the players can play within their playable areas or by moving to any part of the free zone.
Offences related to player positions
While the ball is being served, the other players should remain in their positions and it is an offense to be outside their positions. While the ball is being served, if offences are committed with regard to player positions and service both, first a penalty is given for the offence related to the service. If the ball fails after it has been served, it is disregarded and the penalty is given for the offence related to player positions.   
The following penalties may be given for offences related to player positions
• As a penalty given to the team that committed the offence, the service and a point are awarded to the opposing team.
• The players should revert back to their correct positions.

When a team has received the service after winning a rally with the other team, the 
players of the team that has received the service have to rotate positions clockwise around the court. The player in zone 2 should move to zone 1 and serve the ball while the player in zone 1 should move to zone 6.
Rotation offences
A player rotation offence is a rotation of the sever position in a wrong order. The following penalties are given for rotation offences.
• As a penalty given to the team that committed the offence, the service is awarded to the opposing team.
• The opposing team is awarded a point.
• The players should rotate again so that they are in the correct positions
Summary
In volleyball the players have to position in the court according to the accepted order. The six players of each team should be positioned in two rows of three players each so that there is a front row and a back row. 
There are rules and regulations related to these player positions. When a player has 
to change position, the team has to rotate clockwise so that each player moves by one position.   
Players not being in the correct  positions while the ball is being served and the 
team not rotating in the correct order are considered offences. Players are given penalties for offences related to player positioning and player rotation.

Netball is played between two teams of seven players each. However, twelve 
players can be registered for a netball team, and a netball match can be played with a minimum of five players. Each player should wear a bib showing the abbreviation that indicates the player position and the two teams should wear bibs of different colours so that the two teams can be identified clearly. The captains of the two teams should toss a coin to start the match. The team that wins the toss can select either the ball or the side of the court. After the toss has been won, the two captains should inform it to the umpires who then toss a coin between them selves to select their roles. When the umpire blows the whistle, the two teams should take their positions inside the court. 
In previous Grades you learnt netball skills such as ball controlling, footwork, 
attacking and shooting. The game of netball has been created with the combination of those skills. When you were in Grade 10, you learnt the rules and regulations related to the position of players, playing time, attacking, defending and shooting in netball and also about the hand signals used by umpires in judging netball matches.

For all the offences committed by a team, except for the obstructions caused to a player or players of the opposing team (eg: obstructions, impeding contacts, committing offences by two opposing players simultaneously, obstructions related to goal post), the opposing team is awarded a free pass. If a goal shooter gets a free pass when she is within the goal circle, she cannot shoot that ball.
Any player in the opposing team who is allowed to play in that area can get the free 
pass from the place where the offence was committed.      
Occasions where a free pass is awarded
A free pass is awarded for committing the following offences:
Offences committed in handling the ball 
• Rolling the ball over the ground• Throwing the ball up and catching it again before it touches any other player. 
• Throwing the ball while lying, sitting or kneeling on the ground.
• Holding the ball for over three seconds – this is called the three-second law.• When passing the ball, the distance between the two players being less than 3 feet.

The player throws the ball into the court setting the foot close to the boundary line from outside the court at the place where the ball ran out from. The rules related to footwork and three-second rule should be followed when taking the throw-in.
 A throw-in is awarded when 
• the ball touches the ground outside the court or when it touches a person or an object outside the court.
• a player who is touching the ground outside or touching a person or an object outside the ground catches the ball.
• a player who is touching the ball touches the ground outside the court. 
  Figure 5.4 - Throw-in 
Toss up
On occasions where it is difficult to decide on the player who should be given the ball out of two opposing players, the ball is tossed up between them. The toss up is taken between the two players who were involved in the offence and at the place inside the court that is closest to the place where the offence was committed.
The two players should stand facing each other and their own goal ends with arms 
straight and hands to sides, but feet in any position. There should be a distance of 3 feet between the nearer feet of the two players. They shall not move from that position until the whistle is blown.
For Free Distribution.  48 49The umpire should keep the ball on the palm of her hand that is held at a level that is 
slightly lower than the shoulder level of the shorter player when she is in her usual standing position, and should blow the whistle and toss the ball up from a midpoint between the two players so that the ball does not go more than two feet up.   
A toss up is taken when
• opposing players gain simultaneous possession of the ball with either or both hands;
• opposing players simultaneously knock the ball out of court; • opposing players are simultaneously offside, one in possession of or touching the ball; 
• opposing players make simultaneous contact; • the umpire is unable to determine the last player to touch the ball before it goes out of court; 
• after an accident, the umpires are unable to say who had the ball, or when the ball was on the ground when play was stopped.

Judging netball matches 
It is very important that netball matches are judged following the rules and                         regulations of the game giving players the relevant penalties in order to control netball games and to make decisions. A netball match is judged by two umpires and it is their responsibility to ensure that the following are in order:• the court, shooting posts, and the ball• players are wearing bibs, have trimmed finger nails and have removed jewellery.
• the 3-metre wide free zone around the court has been arranged so that the play or the judging is not disturbed.
For Free Distribution.  50 51• availability of two umpires for controlling the game and for making decisions 
and that they get to know each other.
• the captains of the two teams toss a coin between them and its result is conveyed to the umpires and the scorekeepers.
• the umpires judge the side that they are in charge of.• stopwatches and score keepers are kept ready.        The umpire who wins the toss controls the half of the court that is towards the north. The umpires can use hand signals when necessary in order to further clarify the decisions that are given to players. (Refer to page 62 of Health and Physical Education textbook for Grade 10.)
You can develop the skills necessary for judging netball matches through a 
close study of the above facts and by engaging in play following those rules and regulations.

State what decisions you would give the players as the umpire in the following situations: 
i. The team in blue has received the centre pass. After the umpire 
has blown the whistle, the centre player (C) plays the centre pass 
to the goal defence (GD). This ball is not touched by any player in the centre area and when the ball comes to the goal area it is taken by the wing attack (WA).
ii. The centre player (C) of the team in red passes the ball to the Gall 
Attack (GA) of her team who is in the goal circle of their team and the Gall Attack (GA) runs forwards to catch the ball, but the Gall Defence (GD) of the team in blue intentionally comes into contact with the Gall Attack (GA) of the team in red and the Gall Attack (GA) then misses t he opportunity of catching the ball.          
For Free Distribution.  50 51Summary
Free pass, penalty pass, penalty pass/penalty shot, throw-in and toss up are the 
penalties that are given for the offences committed by players in netball.
Free pass is awarded for all the infringements committed by the player holding the 
ball except for the obstructions caused to the opposing player.
A penalty pass is awarded for the infringements committed by two or more players 
outside the goal circle.
A penalty pass / shot is awarded for infringements committed by players within the 
goal circle.
When the ball goes out of the court, a throw-in is awarded. If it is difficult to determine which of the two opposing players should get the ball, 
the ball is tossed up between the two players.
Gaining knowledge about the infringements for which the above penalties are 
given is important in playing, as well as in judging netball.

For Free Distribution. 52 536 Let us play football 
Football has been played since ancient times and today it is a very popular and 
enjoyable game. A special feature of this game is that it provides the opportunity for the participants to engage in playing for a long time which helps develop all the skills needed for enhancing physical fitness. Two teams of eleven players each are required to play a football match. The team that wins the toss can opt to select the side of the field or to start the play. In football, teams can score goals by playing the ball into the goal of the opposing team. 
The game of football has been created with a combination of a number of skills 
such as dribbling the ball, kicking the ball, controlling the ball, heading the ball, throw-in, defending the field, and goal keeping. You have learnt and practiced those skills when you were in previous grades. When you were in Grade 10, you learnt the skills of kicking the ball, controlling the ball and heading the ball, and you also learnt some of the rules that should be followed in playing football matches as well as the signals used in judging a football match. 
In this lesson we will study some key rules that are relevant to various occasions 
of a football match.

 Kick off
Figure 6.2 - Kick off
A kick off is the method of starting or restarting a play. A kick-off is used in the following occasions:
1.   At the beginning of a match2.   After scoring a goal3.   At the start of the second half of a match4.   At the start of each period of extra time if the two teams are on a tie. 
The procedure for kick-off is as follows:
The ball should be placed stationary on the centre mark. All players must remain 
in their own half of the field of play. The opponents of the team taking the kick-off should remain at least 9.15 m away from the ball until it is in play. After the referee has given the signal, the ball may be kicked so that it either moves forwards or it is directly played into the goal. (A goal may be scored directly from a kick-off.) The player who takes the kick-off can touch the ball again only after it has been touched by another player.

Free kick
When a player commits an infringement, the opposing team is awarded a free kick.
When taking the free kick, the ball should remain stationary and the opponents of 
the team taking the free kick should remain at least 9.15 m away from the ball until it is in play. The player who takes the free kick can touch the ball again only after it has been touched by another player.
The free kick is divided into two as follows: i. direct free kick – a goal can be scored directly from a direct free kick. 
ii. indirect free kick - a goal cannot be scored directly from an indirect free kick.

 Penalty kick
If a player commits an infringement inside the penalty area of his team, a penalty 
kick is awarded to the opposing team. When the infringement is committed, the ball should be in play and the position of the ball is not taken into consideration.
Except for the player taking the penalty kick and the goal keeper of the opposing 
team, all the other players should remain outside the penalty area. 
Facts to be taken into consideration related to penalty kick 
• The referee must identify the player taking the penalty kick.
• The ball should remain stationary on the penalty mark.
• The ball should be kicked forwards.
• The defending goalkeeper must remain on his goal line, facing the kicker, 
between the goalposts until the ball has been kicked.
• If additional time is required for the penalty kick, the time taken for that should be added to the relevant half of the play. Direct free kick Indirect free kick

Figure 6.6 - Offside position
A player is considered to be in an offside position if he is nearer to his opponents' 
goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent. When a player is in offside position the player’s active involvement in play is taken into consideration.The law of offside position will not be applicable if a player receives the ball directly from:
• a goal kick 
• a throw-in• a corner kick   
In the event of an offside offence, the referee awards an indirect free kick to the 
opposing team to be taken from the place where the infringement occurred.
 Fouls and Misconduct
A penalty kick is awarded to the opposing team from the penalty mark if a player intentionally commits a serious offence in the penalty area. If such an offence is committed in some other area of the field, a direct free kick is awarded from the place where the offence occurs. 
A direct free kick is aw––arded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the 
following offence:

A throw-in is awarded to the opposing team when the whole of the ball crosses the touch line, either on the ground or in the air. The throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the ball before it crossed the touch line. • A throw-in is a method of restarting play.• A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.
The following should be taken into consideration when the throw-in is taken: 
• Both foot of the thrower should be touching the ground. • At the moment of delivering the ball the thrower should be facing the field of play.
• Should deliver the ball from behind and over the head.

The kick-off is used for starting the play of a football match or for restarting the 
play during a match.
In football, several occasions where the ball is in play and the ball is out of play can 
be identified separately.
In order to score a goal in football, the whole of the ball should pass over the goal 
line, between the goal posts and under the cross bar  
When a player commits an infringement, the kick that is awarded to his opposing 
team is called a free kick. It is divided into two as direct free kick and indirect free kick.  
The kick that is awarded to the opposing team when a player commits an infringe -
ment inside the penalty area of his team is called a penalty kick. 
 If a player remains nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and thesecond-last opponent, he is considered to be in an offside position.

adapting correct postures 
We have to engage in different activities in our day-to-day life including pushing, 
pulling, lifting weights and lowering weights. When engaging in sports, too, we have to engage in activities which may include pushing, pulling, lifting or lowering. When doing these activities, the body must be kept in correct postures. By maintaining correct postures, damages that could be caused to the body can be minimized and correct posture enables us to perform the activity with ease.
In lesson 3, you identified the principles of biomechanics that influence postures. In this lesson we will learn how to manipulate equipment, applying the knowledge 
of principles of biomechanics.  
Pushing equipment
When pushing something,1. body leans forwards.2. feet should be kept apart and the supporting base should be wider.

Figure 7.5 (b) shows a person is trying to lower some object by standing a little 
away from the object and placing the both feet close together. When this person is standing in this posture, his body does not lie straight. Then the line of gravity lies behind the supporting base. That makes it difficult for him to maintain the balance of the body. 
In figure 7.5 (a) the picture which shows the correct posture, the body of the person 
lies straight. One leg has been moved backwards and the supporting base is wider. The weight is held close to the body.

activities 
Most people in society today have been adapted to a competitive as well as 
monotonous lifestyle. Think of a place where you would like to spend time leisurely taking some rest from your strict, dull routine. Just imagine how comfortable and relaxed you would feel when you are in some natural environment, in a forest, near a lake or a waterfall. Without engaging only in studies and being confined to the classroom, engaging in outdoor activities to gain such knowledge related  to natural phenomena is called outdoor education. We agree that admirable qualities like good discipline, leadership, follower-ship, patience and ability to handle challenges effectively can be enhanced by engaging in outdoor activities in addition to classroom activities which help to produce physically and mentally healthy persons.

Let us study further the following activities that come under outdoor activities:
1. study of jungle crafts 2. mountaineering3. jungle explorations
When we engage in outdoor activities, we should be armed with the necessary 
skills to successfully overcome the challenges we confront. Identifying various environmental conditions and natural phenomena and being prepared to face those situations is especially important when participating in outdoor activities. 
The objective of studying jungle crafts is to acquire the ability to identify the 
nature of action that should be taken to overcome the challenges of nature and to be prepared for that. This can be considered as gaining knowledge about nature including animals.  Study of Jungle crafts 
For Free Distribution. 72 73The following are some of the skills that we should develop in studying jungle 
crafts.         • Forecasting weather by observing animal behaviour
• Finding sources of water• Camping
• Ability to tie different types of knots • Utilizing equipment such as knife, axe• Measuring the height of trees• Measuring the width of a river• Making a bridge• Setting up a bonfire
• Methods of cutting down trees• Identifying the directions by studying the position of the sun, moon, and stars
• Cooking food without using utensils
• Making fire if required
• Observing the footprints of animals and identifying them  
We should find information about the trees, animals, sources of water, mountains, caves and caverns that we come across in the natural environment while studying jungle crafts. 
Challenges confronted when studying Jungle crafts  
When we are in the wild, we become exposed to various hazards. Such hazards can be categorized as follows:
1. hazards related to weather
2. hazards caused by animals3. hazards related to food4. hazards related to water5. confusions regarding  the direction
6. diseases

Footprints
Observing footprints is very important in dealing with the hazards confronted in 
the wild. Observe the footprints of several persons and observe the differences in those footprints. 
Then examine the footprints of some animals. You may examine the footprints of 
animals such as the elephant, deer, cattle, dog, and pig. Make notes of the special features of those footprints. Draw pictures of their footprints in a notebook. Now look at the pictures you have drawn and identify the animal by studying the features of the footprint. Also study how the animals move, and the time, speed and the direction in which they have moved.
Figure 8.6 - Various footprints
Landmarks
Landmarks are very important for us to move about in the wild without facing 
hazardous situations. Natural features in the environment can be used as landmarks and sometimes we have to make landmarks by ourselves. Some examples for using landmarks are as follows:   
• breaking a twig from a branch of a tree and hanging it by the side of the way.
• keeping some fairly big stones arranged in a particular shape• leftover parts from what animals have eaten while they were moving about• places where animals are couched• crushed grass or other plants

Figure 8.7 - Places where animals lie
We study jungle crafts to protect from hazardous situations that we may 
encounter in the forest. The following are some of the strategies that we can adopt while we are in a forest area. 
Camouflaging if we are clearly noticeable to animals, there is 
greater possibility of being attacked by them. Therefore we should be camouflaged in the forest. For that we should wear clothes that have the same colour as plants and trees and the ground.  
Walking cautiously   When we are inside the forest we should walk slowly and quietly taking cover behind trees and by crawling when we pass an open air stretch.   
Imitating animals  Imitate animals always as much as possible. Animals can be imitated by making sounds similar to theirs and by imitating their actions. 
Knowledge on food available in the forest We need to have acquired adequate knowledge on how to find food when we are in the wild in case we run out of or run short of food supplies we carry with us. Forests usually have various kinds of food like yams, fruit, jack and breadfruit. However when you go in search of such food, you may come across poisonous foods, too. In order to refrain from consuming such poisonous food, you can select only those that are eaten by animals.

Figure 8.8 - Mountaineering
Climbing mountains which do not have roads for easy access under difficult 
weather conditions like hot sun, rain and wind can be called mountaineering. Mountaineering is a very good activity for strengthening self confidence. In mountaineering, it is very important that every participant acts with a deep sense of team spirit. Negligence or carelessness of one participant may create a grave danger for the whole team.       
Facts to be taken into consideration in mountaineering  
• Gaining understanding about the flora and fauna of the area.
• Gaining understanding about the condition of soil and rocks in the area.
• Learning the facts that the previous explorers have reported.• Getting the participation of explorers who have experience in mountaineering. • Gaining awareness as to how action should be taken and who should be informed of in case of an emergency.
• Arranging only the essential items so that they can be carried in a rucksack.• Gaining full understanding and training in utilizing safety equipment.• Refraining from engaging in unnecessary, unsafe activities.• Respecting leadership and following orders.• Always working with team-spirit.• Having received training in rope climbing.• Having developed skills in tying knots with ropes. • Using a stick as a support for walking.

Man who evolved gradually over the era of the hunter stepped into the agricultural 
era. Man in the era of the hunter lived a completely savage life in the jungle.
But today the prime objective of jungle exploration is to study the biodiversity 
of the relevant area. Through jungle explorations we can learn about the animals, birds, insects and reptiles living in the wild, the nature of vegetation in the area, streams, brooks and rivers flowing there, topographical features, nature of soil and the rainfall of the area. 
It is important that participants in mountaineering should be in small groups and 
take special care about their safety. As there are dangers involved with this activity, participants should get advice from adults experienced in jungle exploration.       
Facts that special attention should be drawn to in jungle explorations

Summary
In outdoor activities, we engage in various tasks involving ourselves with the 
natural environment. Outdoor activities are organized under the three phases of preparation, implementation and conclusion.
In this lesson we learned about the study of jungle crafts, mountaineering and 
jungle explorations which come under outdoor activities.
Through the study of jungle crafts we gain knowledge about nature of animals, 
plants and trees. 
Mountaineering is an outdoor activity which helps develop self-confidence.
The main objective of jungle exploration is to study the biodiversity.We gain various benefits by engaging in outdoor activities and we should be careful 
about our safety when engaging in such activities.

events in athletics 
Activities related to athletics can also be seen in the everyday life of people, 
in outdoor and in certain indoor sports activities. In athletics there are rules and  regulations specific to certain sports events. There are also general rules and regulations relevant to all the events. The knowledge and the practical skills you develop by engaging in athletics will pave the way for you to live a successful and healthy life. 
Recollect the classification of athletics events, the techniques and rules and              
regulations of race walking and running that you learnt in Grade 10.
In this lesson we will learn the general rules and regulations of athletics events   and 
about sprinting, long distance running and hurdles. We will also engage in practical activities related to them.
General rules and regulations of athletics 
There is a set of general rules and regulations common to all athletics events. There are also specific rules and regulations relevant to running, jumping and throwing events according to the classification of athletics events.
Clothing
Clothing of the participants of athletics events should fulfill the following criteria:
1. Athletes must wear clean clothing.
2.Clothing should be appropriate for the event and made of a non-transparent material.
3. Athletes must not wear clothing that could impede the view of the judges 4. Athletes’ vests should have the identical colour on the front and back
For Free Distribution. 80 81Shoes
When athletes participate in athletics events, rules and regulations related to                
wearing of shoes are as follows:
1. Athletes may compete barefoot.
2. Athletes may wear footwear on one foot only.3. Athletes may wear footwear on both feet.4. The purpose of wearing shoes for competitions is to give protection and               
stability to the feet and get a firm grip on the ground.
5. Other than for the above, shoes must not be worn to get unfair, additional             
assistance (eg: shoes that have been made with springs or similar parts fixed inside should not be worn).
6. A maximum of 11 spikes could have been fixed to the shoe.   
Athlete bibs 
1. An athlete should wear two bibs containing the athlete’s number visible on the 
breast and back. 
2. In high jump and pole vault events, only one bib may be worn either on the 
breast or at the back.  
3. The maximum length and width of a bib should be 24 cm and 20 cm respectively. 
General rules and regulations related to the running track 
1. The length of a standard running track should be 400m.2. The running track should consist of two parallel straights which are connected 
with two semi-circles of which the radii are equal.
3. The width of a running lane should be 1.22 m.4. A running track should consist of a minimum of 8 lanes.5. In all the races up to and including 400 m, each runner should use a starting 
block.
6. In mixed relay events of 4 x 100 m, 4 x 200 m and 4 x 400 m, the first runner 
should use a starting block.
7. In running events of 800m and above that, it is compulsory to take the standing 
start.
8. The direction of running or walking on the track should be anticlockwise. 9.If there are many participants, preliminary rounds of the competition should be held.

Figure 9.1 - Running track
General rules and regulations for field events (jumping / throwing events)
1.Before the beginning of the event, each athlete may have practice trials at the 
competition area. 
2.Once a competition has begun, athletes are not permitted to use the playground or the landing area for practice purposes.
3.In all field events, except the high jump and the pole vault, where there are more than eight athletes, each athlete shall be allowed three trials and the eight athletes with the best valid performances shall be allowed three additional trials (Except for internationally recognized competitions, the number of trials for the competition may be decided at the discretion of the organizers).
4.In high jump and the pole vault three trials are given to make a particular height. 
Running
Running events are classified based on the running distance. In different races, runners run at different speeds. There are accepted rules and regulations, and techniques for each race. The aim of a participant in a running race is to finish some specific distance within a minimum time period. Running speed is very important for this. There are two key factors that determine the running speed. 
1.the stride length of the runner
2.the stride frequency (the number of steps made within one second)
For Free Distribution. 82 83Running speed can be increased either by increasing the stride length or by 
increasing the stride frequency or by increasing both those factors. However, it is important that those two factors are maintained at a moderate level. 
There are two main techniques for starting the run in a running event:
1.  Standing start  – for running events of over 400 m.2.  Crouch start  – for running events of 400 m and below 400 m                eg : 100 m,  200 m, 400m
             4 x 100 m,  4 x 200 m, 4 x 400 m relay races
             100 m, 110 m, 400 m hurdles
According to the classification of athletics events, running events are divided into three types namely, short distance running, middle distance running and longdistance running. In middle-distance running events, running takes place at amoderate speed. Unlike in sprinting, the starting speed is comparatively lower in long distance running.
A running stride consists of three phases:
1.  take-off
2.  flight3.  landing
Flight Take - off  Landing 
Figure 9.2
Short distance running (Sprints)
In sprint techniques, the functioning of legs, movement of hands and the position of the head and the torso are very important. As the race ends in a very short period such parts of the body function at their maximum capacity. 
You have already learnt that the crouch start is used for sprints. For the crouch start 
there are three commands namely, “on your marks”, “get set” and “go”. 
For Free Distribution. 82 83Sprinting technique
• In sprinting the start is very fast. Initially the body is leaned forwards and it then 
gradually becomes upright.
• When finishing the race the speed is slightly reduced and the body is leaned forwards.
• The hands are rotated by about 90
0 forwards and backwards around the shoulder.
• The legs rotate around the axis of the hip.
• The knees are raised higher.
• Running strides are long.   
 Activity
In order to practise the sprint start, come to the running posture following a signal after beginning with various postures and run forwards very 
fast. 
Long distance running
• A standing start should be taken for running events above 400 m and above that. In the standing start only the “on you mark” and “go” (gun shot) commands are given.
 Figure 9.3 - Start of long distance running  
Running technique in middle-distance and long distance running 
• In long distance running, the upper part of the body is kept upright while 
running. 
• As the running speed is increased towards the end of the race, the body is leaned forwards. 
• In long distance running, the running strides are short, and the knee is raised to a moderate level.  
• Hand movement in long distance running is not as fast as in short distance running. 
• The body functions in a relax manner rhythmically.

Running exercises
In previous lessons you have learnt about running exercises and about the benefits  
gained by engaging in running exercises. Let us study some more exercises that can be used to practise the running technique as well as to increase the running speed.

For Free Distribution. 84 85Hurdling is a fast and rhythmic technically activity and is a very interesting one of 
the running events in athletics. Hurdling is a short distance event. Player should run over ten hurdles in this event. Hurdling has a special significance to the field of athletics in Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka won its first ever Olympic medal when Duncan White won a place in a 400 m hurdling race.  
Hurdling events are held as follows in sports competitions at national and interna-
tional levels.Men’s   – 110 m hurdles, 400 m hurdlesWomen’s  – 100 m hurdles, 400 m hurdles   
The ability to run a short distance very fast and to clear the hurdles applying the 
technique are the basic skills that a hurdler should possess.

management and organizing 
through sports 
Sports and sports management are handled with perfect combination at present. Many 
countries in the world have achieved victories and are accomplishing their aims of producing citizens with balanced personality through proper management of sports. For Sri Lanka to achieve such aims, the role played by the school sports managers is very important. You, too, are greatly benefited through proper management of the organization of sports activities conducted under the subject of Physical Education at school. 
In previous grades, you learnt the objectives of rules and regulations in sport, the need 
for such rules and regulations in sport, evolution of the Olympic Games, doping in sports and the tasks involved in the organization of sports at school. 
In this chapter you will learn about the roles of the manager and the followers in the 
organization structure of sports, how contribution is made as a sports manager towards the organization of sports activities conducted at school and also about the organization of sports tournaments.        
Organizations 
There are various organizations in society. Though they are given different names such as ‘family, school, sports club, etc.’ they can all be called ‘organizations’ in general despite the fact that they differ from one another in terms of aims and objectives. 
An organization is “an economic or a social unit which utilizes resources effectively 
for the achievement of set aims and objectives”. 
These organizations perform different functions. There are persons appointed 
to carry out those functions. They have been assigned with various tasks, and a structure has been formed for the assignment of those tasks and for the performance of those functions. It is called the ‘organizational structure’. 
There are several features that are common to organizations. They are;
• having set aims and objectives
For Free Distribution. 90 91• having defined ways of (strategies for) achieving those aims and objectives.
• having persons for the implementation of those strategies.

The Manager
The person who is engaged in the process of coordinating all the resources of an 
organization in order to achieve the aims and objectives of that organization is called ‘manager’. It is the responsibility of the manager of an organization to set aims and objectives for the organization and to formulate policies, strategies and plans to work towards the achievement of those objectives. 
Generally, the management of an organization consists of three tiers.

• Generally, there are managers belonging to different levels of management of different fields in society.
• As far as the school education sector is concerned as a whole, the Secretary to the Ministry of Education is the chief manager and the principal of a school is in the lower management, but as far as a school is concerned, the principal is in the top management. 
Qualities that a manager should possess
• Excellent skills in taking leadership
• Knowledge and skills in his/her subject area
• Good interpersonal skills• Good communication skills• Skilled in making judgments and in analysing• Emotional balance and skills to handle pressure successfully• Skilled in maintaining institutional balance• Flexibility
• Skilled in human resource management
For Free Distribution. 92 93The Follower 
One who is managed, organized, and led by the role of management is called a 
follower. That means a follower is a person who works cooperatively under a leader in order to achieve the set aims. When there are efficient followers, the management process continues successfully. 
Qualities that a follower should possess
• Providing assistance to achieve the common goals. • Respecting the leadership.• Handling pressure effectively.• Carrying out responsibilities properly.• Maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships.• Acting with team spirit.
• Being flexible.
The role of physical education management 
It is very important that matters are handled in proper order to facilitate the 
development of organizations as well as that of persons. That is why people have developed a keen interest in ‘management’. It is important that you, too, deal with matters very sensibly to overcome the present as well as future social challenges. 
The process that includes planning, organizing, directing and handling of human 
and other resources efficiently and effectively for the achievement of the defined aims and objectives of a person or an organization is called ‘management’. 
The process of physical education management, too, should take place in accordance 
with the definition of ‘management’ that is given above. The process of planning, organizing, directing and handling of human and other resources efficiently and effectively for the achievement of the aims and objectives that are defined in terms of physical education should take place under physical education management. Management of resources is very important in physical education management.    
For Free Distribution. 94 95Resource management in physical education 
Resource management of an organization means obtaining resources necessary 
for that organization, to distribute and utilize them and to conserve them making necessary developments in order to achieve the aims and objectives of that organization.
In physical education activities the sports manager is responsible for the proper 
management of resources. These resources can be divided into two main categories namely, human resources and physical resources. In addition to these two, time and finances, too, should be managed as resources.
In physical education, effective management of human resources helps to provide 
opportunities for pupils to gain experiences necessary for the development of their skills, to receive through sports activities the exposure required for the implementation of other common programmes and to develop personality traits like skills in maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships and team spirit.
Management of physical resources in physical education includes:
² planning and identifying resources necessary for the sports 
   section eg: play ground, sports equipment etc.² obtaining those resources² distribution of those resources² maintenance and repairing
Effective management of physical resources :
² enables the use of such resources for multiple purposes.  
 ² provides every one of the school with an opportunity to use the available     resources.  ² helps inculcate good attitudes related to conservation of resources. 
Time and finances, too, should be managed as resources. A sports manager should 
have excellent skills in time and finance management. Such management skills are very important in maintaining a balance between the academic work and sports activities of the pupils.

2. development of attitudes 3. development of skills in managing stress4. acquiring the ability to start the day actively5. personality development6. getting the opportunity to share experiences7.   pupils who have special talents in sports get the opportunity to further develop 
those talents 
Participating in sports activities enables pupils to maintain a healthy body and also to engage actively in studies with a peaceful mind. It also helps the pupils to relieve the monotony and stress caused by continuous studies.
Manage your time properly so that at least an hour can be allocated every day for 
engaging in sports activities which helps you to maintain a good physical, mental and social balance.    
  
For extra knowledge 
The following are some facts to be taken into consideration when planning physical education activities:
• Sports activities should be designed to suit the age and the gender of the participants.
• The activities should be appropriate to the environment.• The activities should be able to be implemented using the resources available with the organization. 
• They should be in accordance with the restrictions and traditions of the school.
• The sports programmes should be designed in such a way that physical and mental needs of the pupils are addressed.
• They should be helpful in training pupils to spend their leisure effectively.
• They should be helpful in relieving the stress and pressure resulting from everyday classroom activities and also in gaining some pleasure.   
• The programmes should be designed in such a way that they provide the opportunity for pupils to achieve higher levels of their talents.

Organizing inter-house sports competitions 
Inter-house sports competitions are important in providing opportunities for pupils to develop their personality. The inter-house sports competitions can be used to identify the talents of the pupils by providing opportunities for all the pupils of the school to participate in sports events and also to facilitate them to develop their talents. The pupils who take part in sports events, and others who possess talents in dancing, leadership skills, organizing skills and creative ability, too, get the opportunity to display their talents by organizing inter-house sports meets.
There are three main phases in the organization of a sports meet
1. organizing pre-meet activities2. organizing activities on the day3. organizing post-meet activities
Organizing pre-meet activities (preparation) 
First the principal has a meeting with the teachers of the school and appoints the necessary committees and decides on the dates to hold the events. Then an action plan is prepared detailing the events and activities to be done each day. This action plan should be implemented under the approval and guidance of the principal. 
Each house should be provided with the details of the events, the programme and 
the conditions for holding competitions. Each house should hold house meetings. At the house meeting, the house captains, sports captains and the other office bearers should be appointed by the house. A timetable should be displayed giving details of the dates and times allocated for selecting pupils for the events, for training activities and for issuing sports equipment to houses for practices. The houses should be informed of the date of issuing specimen application forms and the deadline for receiving applications for the competitions. Preparing the playground, informing the judges, preparing results sheets, organizing the march past, training pupils for the drill display and the school band are activities that should be done at the preparation stages.            
For Free Distribution. 98 99Organizing activities on the day
This includes organizing the competitions, the events and the activities to be done 
on the day of the meet. It is the responsibility of the sports managers to identify the requirements of sports equipment and other materials and make them available at relevant places, prepare an action sheet containing a list of activities to be done by each committee and monitor the implementation of those activities, supervise the preparation of the playground, the flag post and the dais etc., make arrangements for seating, refreshment, awarding certificates and prizes, and to monitor the implementation of the activities related to the awards ceremony and the closing ceremony.

Refreshment Committee Making arrangements for providing refreshment required for all the occasions from the beginning of the competitions to the end of the sportsmeetServing refreshment  
Various committees can be appointed at the discretion of the Organizing Committee and those committees can be assigned with different tasks.
It is noticed that schools hold competitions according to the traditions and cultures 
maintained by those schools and therefore differences can be seen in the way the opening ceremonies and closing ceremonies of different schools are conducted.    
However, despite such differences, holding inter-house sports meet is especially 
helpful in developing the thinking ability and personal and social skills of pupils to build a balanced personality.

A series of competitions of some sport held between teams or persons in accordance 
with a set of accepted rules in order to select the winners is called a tournament.  
Preparing the draw
The draw of a tournament should be prepared so that the concept of “fair competition” is not damaged.
There are several ways of preparing the draw.1.Knockout tournament (Single elimination tournament) 
2. League tournament3. Combination tournament4. Challenge tournament
Out of these four tournaments, let us study the first two.
1. Knockout tournament
When playing a tournament according to the knockout system, the defeated 
competitor is removed from the tournament and therefore this method is called single elimination tournament or knockout tournament. This method is often used at school level competitions in Sri Lanka.   
For easy understanding, this method has been divided into two types as follows and 
how the draw is prepared in each type is explained below:
I. When the number of teams is a power of two. 
II. When the number of teams is not a power of two.
I.   The draw of the tournament when the number of teams is a power of two.
Numbers like 2 (2
1), 4(22), 8(23), 16(24), and 32(25) are powers of two. Suppose that 
four teams namely A,B,C, and D take part in the tournament. When chosen by lot, 
team B got No. 1, team C got No.2, team A got No. 3, and team D got No. 4. (Look at the draw)

play each other. If B wins in the match between B and C, and if A wins in the match between A and D in the first round, the second round (the final round) will be played between B and A. According to this example, A is the winner. 
Calculating the number of matches to be played using the formula
Number of matches  =  n -1 ^n = Number of participating teams &
Number of participating teams  = 4 
    n = 4The number of matches to be played  =  n -1 
Accordingly the number of matches  =  4 - 1 
     =  3
II.  The draw of the tournament when the number of teams is not a power of 
      two
If the number of teams participating in the first round is not a power of two, the 
number of teams coming to the second round should be made a power of two. This is done by awarding ‘byes’ in the first round.  
How byes are awarded
Byes are awarded in various ways. Let us study an example in which byes have been awarded in the bottom – top method.   Suppose that the number of teams participating in the tournament is six.
Step 1Find the number that is the next power of two that comes after six which is the 
number of teams.  The next power of 2 after 6  = 2

For Free Distribution. 102 103Step 2
Reduce the number of teams (i.e. 6) from the next power of 2 that comes after 6 (i.e. 8).
number of teams to which byes should be awarded  =  8 - 6   
       =   2
The number of participating teams is 6 and the number of byes that should be awarded is 2. 
Step 3
Select the order of teams by drawing lots between team captains. After arranging the teams in the order, award byes for two teams each from the bottom and from the top.

Advantages and disadvantages of single elimination tournament or knockout tournament
Advantages
• As losers are removed from the tournament, the number of matches to be played is lower.
• Organizing tournaments according to this method is comparatively easier.• The tournament can be finished within a short period of time.• The amount of physical resources like equipment, funds and stadiums etc. required for holding the tournament is less.
• The tournament can be held with a lower number of referees.   
Disadvantages• The teams or players that lose once are left out from the tournament.• The place that each team wins cannot be selected in the right order beginning from the first place.
• If two strong teams play each other, one team has to leave the tournament while a weaker team may go ahead.
• Sufficient opportunity is not available under this method to identify the team or player with the best skills or to judge the talents of each team or player. 
• In a tournament where there are a large number of participants, the teams that win in a round will have to wait a long time until their next match is played. It dampens their enthusiasm.    
For Free Distribution. 104 1052. League Tournament
Unlike in the knockout tournament, the losers are not removed from the tournament 
in the league method. Each team gets the opportunity to play one another. 
Under league tournament the rotational method is used for pairing the teams. When 
the number of participating teams is an even number (eg: 2,4,6,8,…) , they can be paired easily, but when it is an odd number (eg: 3,5,7,9, …), one team is awarded ‘bye’ and the other teams are paired. 
Calculating the number of matches based on the formula. 
n (n - 1)  
2The number of matches played under league method    =
eg: 
If the number of teams participating in the tournament   =     6   
       n   =    6
    
   Number of matches played      =   n (n - 1)  
2
               =   6 (6 - 1)

Summary
Management and follower-ship are considered  important aspects in any organization. Both managers and followers should possess a number of qualities.
In physical education activities, too, physical and human resources, finances and 
time should be managed. Various benefits can be gained through the management of resources in this manner.
Physical education activities managed at school are divided into three main 
categories as compulsory physical education programmes, co-curricular physical education programmes, and physical education programmes conducted outside school. These programmes which benefit pupils include physical fitness programme, inter-house sports meet, and sports and physical education days. 
When organizing inter-house sports competitions, the organizing activities should 
be managed as pre organizing activities, organizing the meet and organizing post-meet activities.
A series of competitions held in accordance with a set of accepted rules and 
regulations for the selection of winners of some sport are called a tournament. Table - 10.2

For Free Distribution. 11111Let us consume nutritious food 
for a healthy life
Energy required for the existence of all living beings, their development and         
protection from diseases is provided by food. For a healthy life it is important to prepare meals with high nutritional value and also to ensure that food does not cause any danger or harm to the body.
Over the past several years you would have learnt many facts regarding the               
nutrients in food, nutritional problems and how to minimize these problems.
In this lesson you will learn about food safety, food spoilage, adulteration of food, 
food poisoning and how to protect the nutritional value of food and select food items suitable for consumption.
Food safety
Food safety is a scientific discipline describing handling, preparation and storage of food, in ways that prevent contamination and food-born illness.
Factors that affect food safety
1.Biological factorsMicro organisms present in food that are harmful to the body, belong to this category.eg : bacteria, fungi
Micro organisms spoil food and emit toxins, which are usually harmful to man.2.Chemical factors
These include residual chemical substances added to food at various stages.
eg: Prior to harvesting – pesticides
      After harvesting      – chemical substances added to ripen        food and for food preservation
For Free Distribution.  112If vegetables and fruits are not washed well prior to consumption residual agro 
chemicals may enter the body. Long term deposition of such substances may give rise to diseases like cancers and kidney diseases.
The Ministry of Agriculture recommends that the harvest should not be gathered until two to three weeks have passed since the last use of 
agrochemicals.
3.Physical factorsThese include substances such as stones and sand, which can contaminate food during transport, storage and preparation.
Numerous diseases can occur due to one or more factors related to food safety.eg: spoilt food can give rise to vomiting and diarrhoea 
 
Instances where action should be taken to ensure food safety
 
1. Manufacture of food
Within the farm land:
• Adding pesticides according to                                    recommended standards
• Use of natural pest control methods (eg Margosa juice)
    • Use of organic fertilizer• Ensuring cleanliness of farming equipment and farmlandWithin the factory:• Ensuring cleanliness of raw ingredients• Ensuring cleanliness of the manufacturing environment• Ensuring cleanliness of the equipment used in the manufacturing process and the interior of the factory
• Maintaining personal hygiene of staff members

farmland
For Free Distribution. 113• The use of recommended artificial flavours and dyes in recommended                        
quantities during manufacture
Figure 11.2 - Ensuring food safety within factories
2. Transport of food
• Use of wooden boxes and plastic baskets 
to prevent bruises and scratches
• Avoid stacking boxes one on top of the other beyond the available space.
• Use appropriate temperature settings to suit the food items. Eg: milk products should be transported maintaining the ideal temperature
• Use covers to prevent contamination.• Use natural protective measures as much as possible instead of artificial chemicals to prevent food spoilage during transport.
  
3. Storage of food
• Arrange items on the shelf according to their date of expiry and place the items 
with early dates of expiration in front.
• Use measures to prevent damage by insects and other animals such as rats, cockroaches, weevils and termites.
• Maintain the appropriate temperature within the stores according to the               relevant food items.
• Correct use of refrigerators and deep freezers.
► Food items should be stored in appropriate locations in the fridge 
Figure 11.3 - Transport ensuring food 
safety
For Free Distribution.  114► Food that requires refrigeration or deep freezing should be kept at the                
required temperature throughout 24 hours. The refrigerator should not be switched off during the night.
► Food and beverages should not be stored together with substances such as toxic materials, medication, aromatics etc. 
► Meat, fish and ice cream should not be stored together
•

Figure 11.4  – The manner in which food should be stored in a fridge at home
4. Preparation of food
Figure 11.5 - Preparing food ensuring safety
• Avoid using food which has been damaged or consumed by animals• Avoid using spoilt or mouldy food• Keep pets away from the area in which food is prepared• Wash hands well before preparing food• Clean green leafy vegetables well, soak in salt water for some time and then use
• Scrub and wash the outer skin of fruits well

For Free Distribution. 115• Wash eggs before breaking them as the shell may carry bacteria
      eg : salmonella• Cut fruits and vegetables just before cooking  (to prevent browning and loss of vitamins)
• Avoid repeated reuse of oil for frying food• Use clean bowls and correct methods of cooking eg: keep the lid open when boiling Manioc
5.  Consumption of food  
• Keep food covered until consumption
• Avoid use of metal, using clay or glass bowls and wooden or plastic spoons to serve food containing vinegar, as vinegar which contains acid will react with metal and form harmful substances.
• Avoid consumption of food such as potatoes which have become green in colour and manioc which has been exposed to air
• Avoid use of bruised or swollen tinned or packet food 
Figure  11.6 - Covering food
Food Spoilage 
Food spoilage is the presence of any substance in food, which make it unsuitable for consumption.
Causes of food spoilage
1. Action of micro-organisms
eg: mould growing on food
2. Action of other animals 
eg: rats consuming part of the food
3.Interactions between food and environment
eg:  browning, oil rancidity

For Free Distribution.  116Ways of recognizing spoilt food
1. Foul smell
2. Change in colour3. Change in texture4. Change in taste
Negative outcomes of food spoilage
1. Increase in incidence of disease  eg: vomiting, diarrhoea2. Wastage of food3. Economic loss  eg: reduction in income due to loss of crops4. Reduction in quality of food  eg: reduced nutritional value in food due to change in chemical         composition of proteins and other elements following their         breakdown.
  Activity
Observe the following food items after they have been kept outside for several days and they have become spoilt.  Describe your findings on how their colour, texture, shape and smell have changed.
1. Carrots
2. Papaw3. Potatoes4. Bread5. Rice6.Plantains
Food Adulteration
Food adulteration is any means by which the quality of food is reduced.
Food adulteration is done in many ways. Several examples are given below.
  
► Addition of numerous chemicals to food
For Free Distribution. 117► Addition of papaw seeds to pepper
► Addition of melamine to milk powder
► Addition of artificial dyes to tea leaves
► Addition of wheat flour, rice flour, corn flour, brick powder, rice chaff, cattle 
feed and wood shavings to adulterate chili powder, saffron and pepper
► Addition of manioc flour to adulterate corn flour
Problems arising due to food adulteration
1. Negative impact on healthUse of adulterated food can give rise to diseases as well as discomfort.eg: Tartrazine, which is added to cordials, can cause poor sleep at night.
2. Loss of nutrients
Reduction in the amount of nutrients received due to addition of other substances  to food.eg:    The nutritional requirement which one expects to fulfil by drinking a glass of          milk, cannot be achieved when milk is adulterated with water.         Iodine deficiencies occur when non-iodized salt is labelled as iodized salt and          sold in the market.
3. Economic losses
There is a drop in sales when people suspect adulteration and avoid consuming food from these places. Losses can occur even due to legal action and banning of products. Furthermore as people contract diseases due to food adulteration the ex-penses borne by the government for medication and health services increase.
  Activity
Make a list of methods used in adulteration of different food groups including vegetables, fruits, condiments, milk, fish and meat.
Methods of identifying adulterated food
Chemical and physical methods are used to identify food adulteration.
According to the colour, shape, smell and texture the adulterant can be identified.Simple methods in identifying food adulteration are mentioned below.
For Free Distribution.  1181. Sieve (filter ) -  shards of glass, pieces of  iron, metal, plastic, wood, stones, sand, 
cigarette butts can be separated and identified by this method. 
In a similar manner different parts of plants and insects  such as 
cockroaches and  weevils can be separated from food.
2. Smell  -   a strong malodour is emitted when a chemical such as formalin  is added.
  There is a difference in smell between coffee which is unadulterated and which  is mixed with flour.
3. Shape / colour - When formalin is added to fish its red colour gives way to a 
more pale appearance.
Food Poisoning
Food poisoning is defined as the occurrence of an illness due to a toxic substance in food entering the body with food or water.
It can cause the following clinical features, which include abdominal pain, dizziness, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.
Food poisoning occurs due to substances naturally found in food, as well as due 
to other substances incorporated into food during cultivation, manufacture and preparation.  
Instances where toxic substances get incorporated into food 
1. Food which contains naturally occurring chemicals toxins eg: cassava, cabbage, some green leafy vegetables
2. Toxic substances which arise due to environmental factors
 eg: potatoes when exposed to sunlight produce a toxic substance called solanine and turn green in colour 
3. Toxins produced by micro-organisms that grow on food  eg: black mould which grows on peanuts
4. Insecticides and pesticides used in cultivation becoming toxic
For Free Distribution. 1195. Toxic substances produced during cooking
 eg: When pickles are prepared in aluminium dishes the dilute acetic acid in vinegar dissolves the aluminium and produces toxic substances.
 When coffee, meat and potato slices are charred toxic substances and a bitter taste will be produced.
 Reuse of the same oil repeatedly for frying can produce harmful chemicals. 
Figure 11.7 - Occasions when poisons enter food
Causes of food poisoning
1. Micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses
2. ToxinsChemical substances released by bacteria during their metabolic activities are 
known as toxins. They could be present in food and cause food poisoning.
Cooking at an adequate temperature will destroy toxic bacteria as well as the toxins produced by them. Heating for 1-2 minutes is sufficient to destroy the toxic bacteria. However to destroy their toxins the food must be cooked at a temperature exceeding 60 
0C for approximately 30 
minutes.
3. Chemicals
All food items are made of chemical constituents and our bodies also contain                
numerous chemicals. However, the chemicals, which give rise to food poisoning, do not naturally occur in those foods. These chemicals may have been included due 
For Free Distribution.  120to accidental contamination or as an additive to obtain the required taste, smell or 
colour or as a preservative.
Soaking in water helps to remove the natural toxins of cassava and soy-beans.
Food Allergies
Consumption of some food items can give rise to clinical features such as itching, 
urticarial rash, vomiting and faintishness. If this occurs as an abnormal reaction mounted by the body’s immune system against that food item, it is known as a food allergy. Symptoms of allergy can occur with the consumption of any type of food. The same food item will affect different people in a different manner. A food item which causes an allergy in one person, may not do so in another.      
Causes of food allergies
1. Special ingredients in foodThe constituents of some food either acting directly or by stimulating other                 reactions in the body can give rise to clinical features. eg: wine, cheese, yeast extract
2. Chemicals which are added for food preservation
The body gives rise to numerous reactions against these chemical substances. eg: sulphur dioxide and sulphide
3.	 Difficulty	in	digesting	some	food	substances
Some individuals suffer from lactose intolerance. The ease with which infants and young children digest milk products is lost in adulthood.
Clinical features of allergies
       • Itching• Urticarial rash• Warmth at the site of allergy• Red eyes• Running nose
As this condition can be fatal it is important to identify 
food that can cause allergies early on and avoid their use, as well as obtaining medical advice when necessary.

• Peanuts
• Prawns, crabs• Milk• Types of fish• Eggs• Chocolate• Pork, bacon• Preservatives and dyes   
Figure 11.9
• Gluten proteins (corn, rye, barley)   • Tomatoes      • Pineapple
Steps to be taken to prevent allergies
• Always check the food labels to identify any substances that you may be allergic 
to (especially with regard to packet, tin and pre-prepared food).
• When consuming food from outside find out for certain if any allergens have been used in preparation.
• If you have suffered from a serious allergic reaction always wear an allergy bracelet or keep with you a document indicating the allergy.
• When obtaining medication from a doctor disclose any previous allergies especially prior to receiving vaccines.
• Inform all family members regarding any allergies that a family member has so that they can inform a doctor in an emergency.
• If a child suffers from allergies his or her carers, teachers, parents of friends and any adults who are in regular close contact should be informed of this. They should also be informed of the steps witch need to be taken during an allergic reaction. 
For Free Distribution.  122Let us protect the nutritional value of food
The nutritional value must be preserved to obtain the nutrients that are necessary 
for the body and to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
Nutrients may be destroyed in several ways during the process from food                  
manufacture to consumption.  Therefore it is necessary to take steps to improve and protect the nutritional value of food.     
  Activity
Complete the following table with methods of protecting and enhancing the nutritional value of food during food preparation after discussing with adults.
Methods to protect the 
nutritional valueMethods to improve the 
nutritional value
To protect the nutritional value of food attempt to do the following
• When preparing green leafy vegetables first prepare the onions and coconut and 
then add the freshly cut green leafy vegetables. Then cook on a low heat for a short period so that the leaves do not discolour. This will help to preserve the nutritional value.
• Cooking meals in the shortest possible time will protect the colour, nutrient value and taste. Pressure cookers and microwave ovens can be used for this purpose.
• As calcium can reduce iron absorption, avoid cooking foods rich in calcium and iron together. 
• Obtain different nutrients in the same meal by cooking several types of food together
For Free Distribution. 123 eg: add leaves of drumsticks when cooking rice
       mixed green leaf salad       hath maluwa       soups

• Add condiments to improve the taste and give a medicinal value to the meal
• Additional nutrients can be obtained by using fortified food 
eg:  Iodized salt
  Vitamin A fortified oil• To fulfil the amino acid requirement consume pulses and grains together.
• Increase iron absorption by adding lime to food. Add lime juice to a cooked meal once it cools down. If not the heat will destroy vitamin C in lime juice.
• To increase the iron content in the food, add Maldives fish.

Let us consume food suitable for a healthy life
Food is an essential requirement for the existence of all living being. To 
lead a healthy life free of communicable and non-communicable diseases, it is important to select suitable food.
Many types of food are found in the market
  Natural food  Natural food includes food that has had minimal preparation to preserve its natural quality. They do not contain artificial flavours, dyes or aromatics and are healthier than pre prepared food. Natural food contains a lot of antioxidants and therefore helps to protect from diseases such as cancer. In addition they contain a large amount of fibre. Even natural food can have an less favourable effect on the body in instances such as cutting vegetables long before cooking and use of chemical fertilizers in place of organic fertilizers.  
Processed food   Processed food includes food that has been prepared in a manner easy to use or to increase shelf life. Additives are commonly used for  flavour, colour and aroma. These food have high calorie content and less fibre. Therefore by consuming these food the risk of contracting diseases increases.

 Food that is made in a manner that enables it to be 
prepared for consumption over a short period of time is known as instant food. These can be seen in several forms.     
       •  Dried food
    Food that can be consumed after adding water.    eg: tea, coffee, milk powder, soups 
       • Food that can be consumed after adding other 
   ingredients and a short cooking process.
   eg: noodles 
   Some types of fast food are suitable according 
   to health standards while others are not. Therefore it    is important to be vigilant about the ingredients of    these food items when selecting them.
   Food, which is high in energy, sugar and oil content 
   and low in other nutrients, are unhealthy and are    defined as junk food.  
 Therefore even though fast food has the advantage 
 of saving time and provides ease in cooking you 
 must be intelligent enough to avoid what is 
 unhealthy among these food and select only 
 healthy food.

and throwing events in 
athletics
Under the classification of athletics events long jump and triple jump can be 
identified as horizontal jumps while high jump and pole vault come under vertical jumps. The shot put, the discus, the javelin and the hammer are the throwing events in athletics.
Out of these events, we learnt about long jump, high jump, throwing the shot put, 
and the discus in grade 10.  
In this lesson we will learn about triple jump and throwing the javelin and engage 
in practical activities related to those two events.
Triple jump  
Triple jump is a horizontal jump among athletics events. A great deal of energy and tremendous momentum are needed for triple jump that consists of three jumps. It is essential that a speed that can be controlled when reaching the take-off board is maintained while the speed should not be allowed to be reduced in all the three jumps.

Javelin throw
When you were in grade 10 you learnt about the shot put and the discus which comes under field events according to the classification of athletics. 
Javelin throw, too, comes under throwing events. Out of the equipment used for 
putting and throwing events, javelin is a piece of comparatively lower-weight equipment. The javelin is thrown by using the power that is gained by running.
As the shot put, throwing the discus and the javelin are events that involve dangers. Therefore training of those events and holding competitions should be done only under the supervision of teachers.

musculoskeletal system
 
We are constantly in motion during the whole span of life. Three systems in our 
body that help us to do this are the skeletal system, muscular system and nervous system. In motion, the skeletal system acts as a lever. The muscular system provides the power and the nervous system provides the stimulus and coordination. As an adolescent you will find the knowledge of these systems useful.
In grade 10 you learnt about the structure and functions of digestive, respiratory,     
circulatory, excretory and reproductive systems. you also learnt about some diseases that affect these systems and how to prevent them.
In this chapter we will learn about the different systems that help with movements.
Muscular system
Muscles are important for movement of the body as well as for movement of the 
internal organs.
Anatomy of the muscular system
• Different types of muscles perform specific actions in various parts of the body.
• Different postures can be adapted due to the contraction and relaxation of muscles
• Tendons are attached to bones. They are thick and strong and help with movement.
• The muscles are attached to the bones and help with movements• The energy needed is stored in the muscles• The nerves send stimuli for contraction and relaxation of muscles and help with movements
• Special muscles in the face are involved when crying, laughing, showing happiness and sadness
For Free Distribution. 140There are three types of muscles classified according to the function and 
structure     1. Skeletal muscles2. Smooth muscles 3. Cardiac muscles
Skeletal muscles
These muscles constitute 40% of the 
body weight. They are long and cylindri -
cal in shape. The two ends are attached to the bone by tendons. They are called striated muscles due to the horizontal striations seen in the muscle. The muscles are controlled by the brain. They contract in a rhythmical manner and get tired. There are more than one nucleus and a large number of mitochondria in a muscle cell. Glycogen is stored as a source of energy in the muscles.
Striated muscles are present in the arms, legs and diaphragmSmooth musclesThese muscles constitute about 3% of body weight. There is one nucleus in the 
muscle cell. The muscles are long and the striations are not seen. They contract in a slow, rhythmical manner and do not get fatigued.
Smooth muscles are present in walls of arteries, veins and the digestive tractCardiac musclesThe cells branch out. Each cell has one nucleus. A large number of  mitochondria are 
present in the muscle cells. These muscles contract nonstop in a rhythmic manner right throughout one’s life.
Cardiac muscles are present only in the heart.

How does muscular system work 
Contraction and relaxation of muscles
The skeletal muscles help  in movements and to maintain posture. The muscles 
have a narrow end and a broad middle. They are  designed to help with movements that will be efficient.

In figure 13.2  you can see how a skeletal muscle is attached to a bone. In figure 13.3 see how the muscles contract when the arm is being used.
When the elbow is bent the biceps muscle contracts and triceps is relaxed. When 
elbow is extended the triceps contracts and the biceps is relaxed.

Hold a book in your right arm and bend your elbow. Notice how the muscles contract and relax.
To understand how muscles work let us learn how each muscle fibre functions.
The basic structural unit of an organism is a cell. The basic unit of a muscle is 
known as a muscle fibre. Figure 13.4 shows how multiple muscle fibres make a muscle bundle and many muscle bundles make a muscle.

Ratio of fibres
You have learnt about the structure and function of muscle fibres. Recall how your 
friends play in the grounds. One friend can run very fast but gets tired soon and another can run slowly for a long period without getting tired. Various types of muscle fibres help in these situations.
For extra knowledge
The energy needed to perform a task generated by a muscle is known as muscle energy.
The muscles of the student who runs fast will contract and relax very quickly. Whilst the muscles of the student who runs slowly for a long period will contract and relax slowly. 
Sports medicine has helped the progress of sports immensely. Two types of fibres 
have been identified. They are slow twitch fibres and fast twitch fibres. The fast twitch fibres are further categorized into two. In this grade you are expected to study the slow twitch and fast twitch fibres only.
You are born with a particular ratio of these twitch fibres. The friend who runs very fast 
For Free Distribution. 144has a higher ratio of fast twitch fibres to slow twitch fibres whilst the friend who runs 
slowly has a higher ratio of slow twitch fibres to fast twitch fibres.
1. Slow twitch fibres- STF; Type 1
These fibres are also known as red fibres as oxygen is utilized to generate energy (red blood corpuscles transport oxygen). These fibres have a lot of capillaries. The sportsmen with a high ratio of these fibres have the ability  to run long distances successfully.
2. Fast twitch fibres FTF; Type 11
Oxygenation (need to use oxygen) in these fibres is low. These fibres do not utilize oxygen to generate energy. Therefore the ability to contract is more in these fibres. 
Sports persons with a higher ratio of these fibres can perform events that require 
speed such as sprints,  jumps, throws  and excel at them.
Identify the differences between  these two fibres

Uses of skills training in sports
By suitable training we can make a few changes to the fibres we are born with.
• The area of the cross section of the fibre can be increased. Strength can be 
developed by doing  resistance exercises. 
• The number of units in motion are more. Impulses travel to the fibres fast and 
the velocity is increased. Therefore the fibres contract very fast.
• The number of mitochondria present in fibres increases. The production of ATP and storage increases. Thus one does not get tired quickly.
For Free Distribution. 145• The density of blood vessels in the muscles increases. The number of capillaries 
in the muscles increases. This enables the rapid transport of glucose and oxygen to the muscle cell. Excretory products are also transported out rapidly. Thus performance can continue for a longer period.
The above can be transformed depending on the type of event and training  of the sportsman. Therefore suitable measures can be taken to improve the stamina of short and long distant athletes.
The factors that hinder the functioning of the muscular system
1. Nutritional deficiencies
The development of muscles is affected due to nutritional  deficiencies from the time you are a foetus right until you pass the other developmental stages
2. Wrong postures
Wrong postures tire the muscles and cause muscular ailments. When muscles are not used properly a lot of energy is used. Therefore wrong postures  over a long duration can lead to various diseases.
3. Inadequate amount of exercise and rest
The muscles are affected when the body does not get adequate exercise. Rest is needed for cells to regenerate. A person can have physical ailments if he works for a long period without rest. It is important that you do warm up exercise when you engage in sports or exercises, as the muscles can get damaged.
Protecting the muscular system
1. Good eating habits
Balanced meal including calories is important to protect the muscular system. It is important to eat at regular times and to eat natural food as much as possible. It is necessary that you eat high quality proteins and non-vegetarian food.
2. Maintain good postures
Fatigue felt by muscles can be minimized by maintaining a correct posture. Maintaining good postures help to have healthy muscles.
3. Taking  adequate  exercise and rest
An adult should engage in at least 30 minutes of exercise daily. Exercise                   develops the function of muscles , capillaries that are connected to them and 
For Free Distribution. 146nerve endings. Getting at least six hours of sleep a day regenerates the tired 
body. The worn out cells are regenerated and muscles remain the original state by rest. It is important that one does warming up exercises before sports or exercises.
Skeletal system
Anatomy of the skeletal system
The shape of your body is maintained by the skeletal system that comprises 206 bones. 
Special characteristics of the skeletal system 
• The brain is protected by the thick and rounded skull.
• The eyes are protected by the sockets.• Ball and socket joints help perform a wide range of movements• The digits in the fingers help with the ability to hold
• The female’s pelvic bones are designed to assist with child birth• Ribs protect the heart and lungs• The femur is long, broad and strong to bear weight.• Cartilage at end of  bones protects the bones within a joint.• A bone heals even if it fractures• Bone marrow manufactures blood corpuscles
The bones cannot function alone. Muscles help in movement. 
Human bones are initially formed  with cartilage and subsequently replaced by 
bone cells. The deposition of minerals makes it hard. Most bones are hollow. The marrow in the hollow portion of the bone manufactures blood cells. Bones store calcium and phosphate.
Classification of bones depending on the shape1. Long bones- present in arms and legs
2. Short bones- present in the fingers and toes3. Flat bones- skull, ribs, shoulder blades and pelvic bones4. Irregular bones- spine, some bones in hands and feet

Pivot Joint
• The joint where the Atlas (1

meet in the vertebral column
• This joint has been designed so that the head can be moved from side to side 
and up and down

• Ankle and wrist joints have gliding joints
• Movements can be performed to the front and back left and right
Bones and muscles act as levers during movements. A lever is a rod that can be 
moved around a stable point. This bone is similar to the rod.  • Fulcrum or pivot is the fixed point in a lever. Joints in our body are examples of this
• The effort is the power on the lever. It is done by muscles. • The resistance on the lever is the load. A mass raised by the arm is an example.
The movements in our body due to muscle and bones are similar to one of three types of levers

Nervous system
Impulses needed for movements to occur are supplied by the nervous system. We can understand the function of this system by learning about it.
Structure of the nervous system
• Impulses obtained from the environment can be converted to electrical impulses
• Impulses are transmitted in a very short time• Reactions can occur with or without thinking• The brain  controls our actions and is able to memorise them
The nervous system can be divided into two
1. Central nervous system
2. Peripheral nervous system
For Free Distribution. 151Central nervous system
brain (-
Figure 13.12 - CerebrumThe brain and the spinal cord are the components of 
this system. The prominent part of the brain is the cerebrum. This constitutes left and right hemispheres that are divided by a sulcus. Cognitive functions such as memory, intelligence, responsibility, analysis, decent behaviour and learning are controlled by the cerebrum. Perceptions  such as vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, pressure , pain, warmth and cold are  also identified by the cerebrum
Spinal cord (- 
The spinal cord is a cylindrical bundle of nerves that runs down from the brain through the vertebral column.The spinal nerves  arise from both sides of the spinal cord in pairs. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves.
Peripheral nervous system
The 12 cranial nerves starting from the brain and the 31 spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord constitute the peripheral nervous system.Nerve cells are known as neurons. There are three types of neurons

3. Inter neuronsNeurons that transmit impulses between sensory neurons and motor neurons
Functioning of the nervous system
Motor and sensory functionsThe dendrites of sensory neurons start from sensory organs. The stimulus is taken up by the  dendrites in the sensory organ. The axons of these neurons are situated in the central nervous system. The path of the impulses is directed from the organ towards the brain. The impulses in the motor neurons travel from the central nervous system to the effector which is the muscle.
The sensory organs such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin receive  the 
stimulus and impulses are sent via the sensory neurons to the central nervous system as messages. The central nervous system send back a message with regards to the action that should take place via the motor neurons to the effector.
Reflexes
In sports we think of the action needed to perform. Sometimes we react to an impulse instantly without having to think. This is known as a reflex.
Recall how you reacted when your hand touched a hot electric iron. You may 
remember removing your hand immediately? That is a reflex action.
The stimulus is the heat. It feels to the skin slowly. Impulses travel from the 
skin through the sensory neurons in the spinal cord. The inter-neurons in the spinal cord sends impulses to the hand along the motor neurons. The hand is removed immediately. The message reach the brain little later and after the                                                    immediate response the person will realize the incidence that occurred. The harm is minimized as the action is done very fast. 
The hand is taken off without our knowledge. It is known to us only after the reflex 
action. This pathway that impulses travel is called a reflex arc.

Conditioned  reflexes
Scientists say that other than the innate reflexes we are born with, experience 
can develop reflexes. Reflexes that are developed from experience are known as conditioned  reflexes. The pathway to these new reflexes is via the brain. Complex conditioned reflexes compared to the simple conditioned reflexes may not last 
For Free Distribution. 154throughout life. Conditioned reflexes could be developed by systematic training. 
Thereby complex sports skills can be performed in the  correct manner without difficulty.

1. Refrain from smoking2. Abstaining from using illicit substances3. Providing  pregnant mothers and adolescent females proper nutrition4. Exercising5. Leading a stress free life  and being happy6. Getting adequate sleep and rest7. Protecting the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin
We learnt, there is a function of contraction and relaxation of muscles. For this action 
energy is needed. The energy is generated from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in mitochondria that is present in the muscle.  
ATP molecule Adenosine – Phosphate – Phosphate – phosphate One adenosine molecule is attached to three phosphate molecules. Energy is 
generated when a bond between two phosphate molecules is broken. This energy is used for the contraction of muscles. 
When ATP gets broken repeatedly ATP gets depleted. After energy is generated 
adenosine and 2 phosphate groups remains together to form Adenosine diphosphate. How energy is supplied during movements
For Free Distribution. 155ATP                   ADP + P + Energy       
ADP cannot generate energy again till it is converted to ATP. For that the released 
phosphate should get attached. Energy needed for the production of ATP occurs in two ways. 
      1. Anaerobic method 
      2. Aerobic method 
1. Anaerobic method
The glycogen stored in the muscles are used for this purpose. In speed events energy is produced without utilizing oxygen. Under this method while producing energy it produces lactic acid. This energy is utilized to convert ADP to ATP.
Glycogen 
 Lactic Acid   +   Energy
                                             
This method can generate only a small amount of energy and also it can be supplied for a short period only. Lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscles and they get fatigued. In the presence of oxygen, the lactic acid is cleared and relieved the muscle from fatigue. 
In events like 400 running this method is used to produce energy. In the final stages of 800m and 1500m events this method is used. Untrained athletes run the last few stages of a 400m event at a slow speed due to the accumulation of lactic acid. 
2. Aerobic method
Glucose and fatty acids are used to generate energy in this method. Glucose or fatty 
acid in the presence of oxygen produce energy. The energy generated is used to convert ADP to ATP. Carbon dioxide and water are the by-products of this process.        Glucose + CO
2  CO2 + H2O + energy
Fatty acid  + O2  CO2 + H2O +  energy
          As oxygen is used in this method, it is known as aerobic method.    For muscle contraction
For Free Distribution. 156This method produces large amounts of energy. Energy generated by this method in 
not available very fast. Energy produced in this method is used in sports that take long duration of time such as Marathon, 10000m run etc.
Other than above methods there is an another method known as creatine phosphate method. Creatine phosphate (CP) also known as Phosphocreatine (PCr), is a molecule 
that serves as a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in skeletal muscles. When energy has to be supplied immediately, breakdown of creatine phosphate will provide the required. 
Creatine phosphate 
 creatine + Phosphate + Energy 
This energy will be used to convert ADP to ATP. This method can function with or 
without the use of oxygen. As it does not use oxygen, sometimes it is referred to as the Anaerobic Alactic method. 
Events such as 100m, 200m, 100m x 4 relay, jumps, throws and carrying weight, which require a burst of energy instantly, specially at the beginning (first 2-3 seconds) is supplied by this method. 
Involvement of the muscular system during exercise
• There are many ways that energy is generated for the muscles to act. During 
high impact exercise and low impact exercise energy is produced in different ways.
• In movements, muscles that are used more and use more force are stronger and bigger. It is due to the cross section being larger,
• By exercising, the endurance and flexibility can be improved.
• The number of mitochondria are increased and ATP increases.
• During training the lactic acid breakdown becomes fast.• By exercising the activity becomes more efficient depending on the type of muscle fibres you possesInvolvement of the different systems during exercise
For Free Distribution. 157• Larger and stronger muscles are situated in places where there is a lot of strain 
on the body.
• To prevent muscle injury during strenuous activities muscles get fatigued.• By training the density of capillaries are increased.• The time taken to produce lactic acid can be lengthened by training• By training, cardiac muscles get strengthen
Involvement of the skeletal system during exercise
• The limb bones are strong and long to bear the weight of the body and get stronger when exercising
• Presence of ball and socket joints help to increase the range of movements
• The natural position of the atlas vertebra help in a range of movements of the head.
• Muscles are attached to joints which aid in movements and get stronger with exercise.
• The natural position of the vertebral columns helps in the ease and efficiency of movements.
• Presence of arches in the feet help in efficient walking and running.
• The joints in the feet help to absorb the impact of vibration.
Involvement of nervous system during  exercise
• Conditioned reflexes are developed
• Unnecessary movements are reduced due to the impulses being directed appropriately
• The parasympathetic nervous system works more during rest• During exercise the sympathetic nervous system works more• The organs work more efficiently eg: heart and lungs
• Thirst makes us drink water to compensate for the volume of water that gets excreted as sweat during exercise.
• Fainting attacks occur as a measure to regain oxygen lost during exercise to the brain.
For Free Distribution. 158Summary
Three systems are involved for movement. The structure of these system have been 
designed to help with these actions efficiently.
The muscles help in movement by contraction and relaxation .The skeletal system acts as a lever through the connection of joints.The nervous system generates the required  impulses for movements.The energy needed for movement is obtained by the breakdown of ATP to ADP. 
The ADP broken down is converted to ATP from energy obtained by the aerobic and anaerobic systems.
When the systems do not function as desired, the efficiency of the movements 
are reduced. By preventing this we are able to maintain good postures for good productivity and efficiency. 
Exercise help in strengthening the muscular, skeletal  and nervous systems.

related to motor skills
In order to lead a healthy life it is necessary to maintain physical, mental and 
social fitness. The complex life styles we lead today have made the modern man extremely busy. Activities that require a large amount of physical exertion in the past are now done easily with the use of modern technology. Furthermore, we are at risk of developing non-communicable diseases from a younger age due to the unhealthy lifestyle. Thus, it is necessary to maintain physical fitness through fitness programmes related to motor skills at your school as well as at home. Development of the main components of fitness related to motor skills will enable you to demonstrate better skills in sports and help you to engage well in day-to-day physical activities. As you already possess some of these skills, you will be able to develop them further through practice. 
In Grade 10 you have learnt about health related fitness factors and programmes to 
develop these. 
In this chapter you will be able to learn about components of fitness related to motor 
skills and exercises to develop them.
Components of fitness related to motor skills
There are 6 components in fitness related to motor skills.
1. Power
2. Agility3.Coordination
4.Balance
5.Speed
6.Reaction speed
For Free Distribution. 160Power
The ability to exert or release a maximal force in the shortest time is known as 
power. It can also be defined as the ability to move by instant exertion of muscle force against resistance. Power is a product of muscle strength and speed.
Power is essential in all sports. However, some sports require more power than 
others.
Examples of instances where power is important in sports
• Weight lifting
Figure 14.1- Weight lifting
In events such as snatch and power clean, in order to succeed it is necessary to 
lift a heavy weight instantaneously. The competitor with greater power would win such an event. The resistance is produced by the weight lifting equipment, which is overcome by muscle strength which will result in movement of the equipment.
• AthleticsEvents such as throwing the shot put and the take off of the long jump require 
competitors to have developed greater power. In throwing the shot put, it is necessary to concentrate the power in your body on to your throwing arm and to let go of the shot put very quickly. This requires training in specific technical skills of throwing the shot put.
For Free Distribution. 161Similarly, the power exerted on the take off board in long jump enables the athlete 
to jump a longer distance. Therefore the athlete who can instantly release the power in his legs during long jump is able to demonstrate greater skill.
Further examples of how power is useful in sports include;
 •   spiking in volleyball •   the power exerted at the start of a short distance running event 
Activities to improve power
I. Throwing a medicine ball          
Medicine balls are made to different weights. The medicine ball can be thrown both forward and backwards using both arms. The ball can be thrown using one arm as well. The steps noted below should be followed when throwing a medicine ball.
• Stand with both feet parallel to each other.
• Hold the medicine ball close to your chest using both hands. 
• Bend the knees and move your body downwards, while holding the medicine ball.
• Raise your body while fully extending your arms and throw the medicine ball as far away as possible quickly.

II. Jumping exercises (these exercises need to be done quickly)
• Hop 5 steps forward using your left leg. 
• Hop 5 steps forward using your right leg. 
For Free Distribution. 162• Keep both feet together and jump forward.
• Keep a few small boxes an equal distance apart and hop over them with 
one leg (This exercise should be carried out using both feet alternately).
 Activity
Use items that can be found in your school and neighbourhood and 
plan activities that can be done to develop power and carry them out in your playground.
Agility
Agility is the ability to instantaneously and smoothly change course, controlling the direction and position of your body.
In certain sports activities it is necessary to quickly and instantaneously change 
your posture. When changing from one posture to another, agility is required to identify the next change in posture and to change into it quickly.
Examples of instances where agility is useful in sports
Figure 14.3 - Football
• In sports such as rugby, football and basketball it is necessary to take the ball 
to the goal while avoiding the players from the opposing team (in order to avoid one’s opponents while moving forward, it is necessary to be able to instantaneously change posture).
• In sports such as football and hockey, the goalkeeper needs to change his/her posture depending on how the ball is coming towards him/her.
For Free Distribution. 163• Agility is very useful in sports such as javelin throw and hurdles.

Coordination is the ability to use your senses such as hearing and vision and 
different parts of the body together, to perform tasks smoothly and accurately. For good coordination there should be optimal functioning of the nervous system and 
the musculoskeletal system of the body. Coordination is important for all sports.
Examples of instances where coordination is useful in sports
Figure 14.6 - Badminton
• In sports where rackets are used, such as table tennis, squash and badminton, 
there should be good coordination between the eyes and hands. It is important for the player to see the ball and to move the racket to where the ball is coming from.
• In parades to act on a given command the participants need to coordinate what they hear with their musculoskeletal system and move their hands and feet accordingly.
• Competitors with good coordination excel at sporting competitions.

 interpersonal relationships 
Good interpersonal relationships are positive relationships between two or more 
people. In our lives, we have to associate with others all the time. In early childhood our relationships are restricted to our family, but when we commence schooling these relationships extend to our school friends and teachers. In addition, participation in sports and other extra curricular activities leads to building relationships with others in our community. As adults, we build relationships with various people in society including those we meet in universities and other educational institutions, workplaces and in the society at large. 
In grade 10 you have learnt about emotional balance and stress management, which 
are necessary for mental and social well being. 
This lesson teaches you how to maintain good interpersonal relationships.

relationships
Figure 15.1
There are many advantages in maintaining good interpersonal relationships with others in the society. Much can be learnt by having relationships with people from varying age groups, religious and ethnic backgrounds, diverse areas of knowledge and socio-economic strata. We must have the ability to understand those who we associate with and be able to identify their skills, habits, talents, likes and dislikes.
Working in a group helps us to develop our skills in cooperation, problem 
identification, problem solving and decision-making. 
Through association with elders we learn customs, habits, laws and regulations in 
the family, community and the country.
In addition skills in exploring, observing and reviewing will improve our ability to 
understand the world around us and people living in it. 
Good interpersonal relationships develop our ability to understand the emotions of 
others and to respond to them appropriately. They improve our skills in effective communication and enable us to receive love and respect from others and to live harmoniously in society.

Communication skills are required to exchange ideas, express emotions, hold       discussions and solve problems. 
3. Make correct decisions        
We often have to make decisions, when            
associating with others. These decisions may include simple decisions such as “What game shall we play this afternoon?” as well as         decisions that require deep thinking such as " which stream of subjects should I select for advanced level examination?''. When making a decision, it is important to discuss with  others and to respect their opinions.
4. Self-awareness
The ability to appreciate your own emotions, beliefs, likes and dislikes is known as self-awareness. It enables us to be aware of the way we should behave during interactions with others.
5. Critical thinking             
In decision making you must learn to consider all the 
available information and critically analyse it.
6. Creative thinking

For Free Distribution. 17716Let us identify challenges in 
adolescence
  
The World Health Organization defines adolescence as the ''period between 10 and 
19 years of age''. This is the period of transition from childhood to youth. This transition brings about many changes in adolescents and  pose many challenges to them. Knowing how to overcome the physical, social and psychological changes will help you to successfully face the challenges associated with them. 
In grade 10, you learned about various challenges you face such as sport injuries, 
accidents in daily life, disasters and sexual abuse.
In this lesson you will update the knowledge you gained in previous grades on 
adolescence and learn about the challenges faced during adolescence.
Why is adolescence an important period in your life?
• It is the period of  transition from childhood to adulthood
• It is a period when future citizens are formed
• Adolescents  are a resource for the country
• It is a period  of rapid physical, mental and social changes occur
• It is a period you are ready to take on responsibilities
• It is a time you are ready to explore and experiment

• Increase in the size of genitals  
• Development of acne on the face
• Increase perspiration and body odour
• Production of sperm
• Adam’s apple (larynx) becomes prominent
• V oice becomes deep
• Growth of beard• Increase deposition of fat in subcutaneous tissues
• Appearance of axillary and pubic hair
• Increase in size of genitalia Development of acne on the face

• Start of menstruation
• Production of vaginal secretions
In addition to physical changes mentioned in the chart above, mental and social changes too occur during this period.
              
1. Interest in one’s body
2. Interested in working for the common  
good
3. Tend to stand up against injustice4. Desire to experiment5. Greater creativity6. Prefers to make independent decisions7. Desire to display capabilities  and be

10. Development of sexual feelings11. Prefer company of adults
12. Interested in aesthetic activities
Do you know the reason for these physical and mental changes ?
Many of the physical and mental changes in adolescence occur due to the changes 
in hormones.
Due to production of FSH and LH hormones by the pituitary gland, oestrogen is 
secreted by the ovaries in females and testosterone is secreted by the testes in males. The action of these hormones cause secondary sexual characteristics in males and females.
An accelerated growth or a growth spurt is seen because of the action of the 
hormones. Many changes in the reproductive system such as production of sperm and activation of ovaries occur due to these hormones.
This growth spurt occurs between the ages of 9 and 12 years in girls and between 12 and 14 years in boys.
Growth spurt of girls                        Growth spurt of boys

eg:     Influence of opposite sex     Influence of peers     Influence of advertisements     Behaviour and attitudes of family, relations and friends you associate with
Decisions made during this period tend to be influenced by feelings and with 
little concern about the outcome. The reason for this is the underdevelopment of the fore-brain. Therefore remember to take advice from elders (parent, teachers) 
when making decisions.
Problems and challenges during adolescence
1. Problems related to nutrition
Improperly balanced meals, inadequate food, fast food, food made with large amount of wheat flour, oil or sugar may lead to obesity and other illnesses. Malnutrition at this age will have an effect on your next generation as well
        2.Problems associated with the development  of secondary sexual characteristicsAmong males, delayed growth of beard, size of the penis, changes in the voice among girls preoccupation with the size of the breasts, irregularities in the menstrual cycle, pain and discomfort during periods  are some problems faced by adolescents. 
Menarche and production of semen depend on 
various factors such as genetic composition, environment, growth and level of nutrition. 
3. Problems due to sexuality
• Myths regarding sexuality
 eg: Menstruation being considered a period of uncleanliness• Sexual abuse
• Pregnancy
Pregnancy could occur due to rape or even having sexual intercourse out of ignorance. Getting pregnant leads to many problems as they are mentally and physically not prepared for such.
Figure 16.4
For Free Distribution. 1814. Problems due to peer groups            
Figure 16.5Peer suggestions and attitudes are 
important at this stage. Unwillingness to go along with them may cause rejection and isolation from the group. As a result experimenting with illicit drugs, alcohol, smoking and engaging in unsuitable sexual activities at this stage can lead many problems.
5. Problems encountered with the media
Misleading advertising and false propaganda may create problems, if you try to experiment with them. 
6. Problems due to education and exam pressure
•  Difficulties in understanding and remembering school work•  Being scared of the reactions of parents and society due to failure in exams•  Difficulties securing a job due to poor qualifications
7.Problems arising from the use of illicit substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco and banned stimulants
• Due to use of illicit drugs, one can be rejected by society, education can be jeopardized, be expelled from school or work place, get involved in theft  which can lead to being jailed or  sent to probation via the judicial system.
• Using banned stimulants can lead to long term harm to the body or even cause death. In addition one will be banned from taking part in competitive sports, victory  declared null and void and lead to shame.
8. Problems due to growth and appearance 
Both males and females during this period are concerned about the body, complexion, height, being fat or thin, hair, acne and fungal infections. Boys may want to increase their physical strength, while girls may want to improve their appearance.
Unwanted pregnancies
Many of the physical, mental and social changes that occur during adolescence prepare girls to bear children in a responsible way  in the future. Adolescence is the period where you prepare yourself and continuously grow until about 20 years for this task. Therefore you are not yet ready for it at this point in time. Mental and social preparation is needed to become a parent even if a girl is physically ready 
For Free Distribution. 182to bear a child. This preparation varies depending on your religion, culture and the 
country you live in. Getting pregnant is a very responsible task. You should not take that responsibility until you have completed your education, attained economic stability and you are ready to bring up a child according to socially accepted norms.
Some girls have unwanted pregnancies due to their poor sexual education and by 
acting out their feelings instead of rational thinking. Boys who become fathers due to sexual liaisons at an inappropriate age face psychological and social problems. 
Rape is a cause of unwanted pregnancy. Perpetrators of rape can be mentally ill 
or behave very irresponsible. However irresponsible behaviour of victims too can play a role in some instances.
The following factors can also be reasons for pregnancy in adolescence.
Table 10.1
Physical changes Psychological changes or social factors
Sex hormones leading 
to;• Sexual stimulation
• Physical develop-ment• Attraction towards the opposite sex
• Romantic relationships
• Desire to be outstanding
• Desire adult company
• Desire to experiment
• Interest in one’s body
• Ignorance about outcomes of sexual intercourse and pregnancy
• Not being concerned about one’s safety
Problems that arise from unwanted pregnancies
Becoming a parent before you attain physical, mental, social and financial stability can bring about undesired difficulties for you and the offspring.
Some problems can be isolation from society, early termination of education, 
menial jobs, fear, uncertainty about your and your child's future, early and forced marriages leading to despair, unhappiness and possible divorce.
A baby born under such circumstances might be malnourished and may even die at 
an early age. The society may consider such children as illegitimate and marginalise them. It has been seen that some people perform abortions to avoid unwanted child birth.
For Free Distribution. 183However, abortion is illegal in Sri Lanka. Abortions performed illegally and secretly 
in non-sterile environments can be hazardous to health and even lead to death of the mother. Such illegal abortions are considered on offence and penalized.
Under no circumstance can teenage pregnancies be approved. However knowingly 
or unknowingly if one gets pregnant, help should be sought from parents, close relatives as well as social service agencies without delay. 
Good qualities of an adolescent
      • Creativity and exploration
• Bravery
• Aesthetic sense
• Generosity
• Dedication to and enjoyment of social service
• Setting an example to peers and young 
• Democracy
• Fairness
By using these qualities in a positive manner, you will be able to overcome challenges easily.

186 For Free Distribution.17Let us prevent sexually 
transmitted diseases  
A    sexually  transmitted disease (STD), is a disease that is contracted from  a 
sexual encounter with a person who is already infected with the disease. They can be contracted from an unprotected sexual encounter, sharing needles and unscreened blood transfusion. Sexually transmitted diseases are also spreading rapidly across the world. Unfortunately, adolescents contract these diseases due to lack of proper knowledge about them. Therefore it is important to know about STDs to prevent from contracting and spreading STDs
In the previous grades you learnt about communicable and non-communicable 
diseases and methods of  preventing them by leading a healthy lifestyle.
In this lesson, you will learn about sexually transmitted diseases and preventive 
measures.
Gonorrhoea
Signs of disease
- A white discharge or secretion from a man’s penis or a burning sensation or pain during urination.
- In females, occasionally a discharge or secretion from the vagina is seen, but  this is rare. 
- Females do not show signs of infection in the early stages.- A baby can get infected from an infected mother during birth. The baby’s eyes can be affected leading to loss of sight.
Figure 17.1Sexually transmitted diseases

187 For Free Distribution.Genital Herpes
This can be transmitted during vaginal intercourse with an infected person as 
well as from kissing, or having oral or anal intercourse with such a person.
Once the virus enters the body, it will be in your system for life and symptoms 
will manifest on and off.
Signs of disease-	 It	starts	with	liquid	filled	bubbles	and	lead	to	painful	wounds- It takes between  10-14 days for the initial wounds to heal- Pain or burning sensation when urinating- Fever- If a healthy person comes into contact with herpes bubbles that contain the   virus, he may get infected.
Figure 17.2
The disease may occur even after an initial cure due to the following:
• Stress and fatigue
• Fever and other severe infections• Menstruation• Certain medicines• Pregnancy• Any	from	of	immune	deficiency	
Although can be controlled, a cure has not been discovered for genital herpes as yet.
Syphilis
Symptoms appear between 9-90 days after being infected. Syphilis is contracted 
chiefly	by	infection	during	sexual	intercourse,	but	can	pass	on	to	a	baby	during	
pregnancy. 
 This can be transmitted via unscreened blood transfusions too.

188 For Free Distribution.Symptoms and signs
- Painless lesion around or in the genitalia-	 Inflammation	of	inguinal	lymph	nodes
Figure 17.3
If proper treatment is not taken early, symptoms may manifest again after six months.
Chlamydia
Chlamydia can be transmitted through vaginal, anal or oral intercourse. 
There is a possibility of a child born to an infected mother becoming blind.Symptoms and signs
- Discharge from vagina penise-  Pain or burning sensation during urination-  Cervix is affected, manifestation of symptoms is delayed in females-	 Inflammation	of	area	around	the	genitalia	in	males
Genital warts
Symptoms
- Warts that look like small pinkish scales are seen in groups of two or more or individually in areas around the vagina and penis
-  In case of anal intercourse, the warts may appear around the anus, and in case of oral sex, they may appear around the mouth
-  May be a cause for cervical cancer.
This condition can be managed, but it cannot be permanently cured.
HIV/AIDS  
HIV/AIDS	is	caused	by	the	human	immunodeficiency	virus.
Let us concentrate more on HIV/AIDS that has become a major problem.   

189 For Free Distribution.HIV/AIDS
Methods of transmission
1.Due to unprotected sexual intercourse (among homosexual or heterosexual 
persons)
2. Via unscreened blood transfusions3. From an  infected  mother to children:
-   during pregnancy-   during  delivery of baby-   through breast milk
4. Using unsterilised needles (injection) by oneself or in a group
eg: using drugs, creating body tattoos. 
Illnesses are prevented by the body’s own immune system by destroying germs. When infected with HIV , the immune system gets weak and the body becomes more susceptible to illnesses.
The symptoms of HIV manifest from 3-12 years after the virus enters the body. 
It may take even 10 years to manifest symptoms. Gradually, the body’s immunity decreases. Due to this weakened immunity, other illnesses are contracted which can lead to death.
Any type of infection will make an AIDS patient very ill. Symptoms manifest 
depending on the type of infection.
Symptoms
► Loss of weight in a short period
► Diarrhoea lasting a long time
► Fever lasting for more than a month
► Tuberculosis
► Pneumonia
In addition,- breathlessness, fatigue and cough lasting a long time-	 inflammation	of	neck	and	axillary	glands
190 For Free Distribution.- oral candidiasis
- night sweats- loss of appetite
A large number of people are unaware that they are infected with HIV as it takes a long time for symptoms to manifest
The HIV virus cannot survive in a normal environment. It can survive in living cells only. The virus is predominantly present in the blood of an infected person.
Other secretions where on the virus can be found
-  Semen-  Cervical and vaginal secretions- Breast milk
Small quantities of the virus can be present in saliva, tears, sweat, urine and faeces, 
but illness cannot be transmitted from these secretions.
AIDS is not transmitted by:
- shaking hands- mosquitoes- kissing and embracing- playing group sports- sharing the utensils such as cups, plates,towels etc - sharing the same household, bed etc- sputum, nasal secretion and saliva- toilets
When HIV enters the body, it grows rapidly and produces antibodies. When	AIDS	was	first	identified,	it	was	found	that	three	times	more	men	than	women	
were infected. At present both males and females are equally infected.
Women are three to nine times more likely than men to get infected with AIDS 
because the wall of the vagina is thin and also after intercourse, sperm remain in the vagina for a relatively long period. Further, semen contains more virus than vaginal 
191 For Free Distribution.secretions thus women are more likely to get AIDS than males.
Inadequate support from sexual partner to prevent the spreading of AIDS makes it 
a serious concern.
Women face many problems within the family and society when they get infected 
with HIV .
A newborn of an infected mother is likely to be infected. If both parents are affected 
they may die prematurely and their children become orphans. This is likely to become a major social issue.
Detecting HIV infection
         1' Blood tests to detect  HIV antibodies
There are two tests available:
i'  ELISA Test 
ii'  Rapid Test 
If	either	of	these	tests	is	positive	for	HIV,	a	further	confirmatory	test	has	to	
be performed as these are only screening tests. They cannot detect HIV during the 
first	three	months	which	is	called	the	window	period.
2.	 -Confirmatory	test
 -Western Blot test
Importance of HIV testing
1. Once diagnosed as infected with HIV , ART (Anti Retroviral Therapy) can be 
given
2. By taking ART, quality of life and life span can be increased3. When proper treatment is taken, the concentration of the virus is reduced and the chances of infecting another person is become minimal
4. By identifying infected people, the illness can be prevented from spreading5. By taking ARV (antiretroviral drugs), maternal transmission of the virus during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be reduced.
192 For Free Distribution.If you have had unprotected sexual intercourse, it is important that you 
get tested for HIV . Testing for HIV is done at all veneraeology clinics in government	hospitals	island-wide	free	of	charge	and	confidentiality	is	
maintained.
Prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases
1. Postpone sexual activities until marriage2. Limit sexual activities only to your spouse3.   Refrain from unsafe sexual activities 4. Identify risky situations in society  and protect yourself from them5. Maintain a strong  family unit6.If you suspect you have a sexually transmitted disease discuss with a doctor immediately
7. If you have a sexually transmitted disease take medication 8. Avoid sexual activity during an infected period9. Avoid using illicit substances
People who have a higher likelihood of being infected with HIV 
and other sexually transmitted diseases
-   Commercial sex workers
-   Those with multiple sexual partners-   People who engage in homosexual activities-   People who have warts or wounds on their genitalia-   People who share needles to inject illicit substances-   Offspring of HIV positive mothers
People who are HIV positive can have many psychological problems and emotions 
such as shame, anger, suspicion, stress and fear. Activity
Write an essay on the effect of sexually transmitted diseases on biology, economy and culture.
193 For Free Distribution.Summary
Sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted during sexual activity between an 
infected person and a healthy person.
Common sexually transmitted diseases are syphilis, herpes, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, 
genital warts  and HIV/AIDS.
AIDS is a dangerous illness that weakens the immune system and makes people 
more vulnerable to other illnesses.
Sexually transmitted diseases also give rise to physical, psychological and social 
problems.
The best way to prevent contracting sexually transmitted diseases is to engage in 
safe and healthy sexual practices.
